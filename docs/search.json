    "text": "The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.\n\n\nBasic Format\nThe income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit.\n\nRevenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the cost of goods sold is subtracted from revenue to obtain the gross profit.\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/creating all of the goods sold that generated the revenue. For example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the revenue reported above, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes.\nTo calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory. This accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.\nGross profit is revenue - COGS. It essentially shows how successful the main selling part of the business has been.\n\nThen, we subtract other expenditures and income that are incidental to the main business of the company (so not the main reason for the company, but still expenses/income used while running the company).\n\nExpenditures include things such as salaries, lighting, heating, bank interest, delivery costs, advertising, research and development.\nExpenditures can also include taxes.\nIncome can come from charging interest on a loan for example.\n\nWhen we subtract all other expenditures for the period from gross profit, we get net profit. We can also subtract subsets of these expenditures.\n\nSubtracting only operating expenses (things needed to run the business operations) from gross profit gets us operating profit.\nSubtracting operating expenses and financing expenses (loan interest) gets us profit before tax.\nSubtracting all expenses gets us net profit.\n\nNet profit is included in the balance sheet as equity/capital.",

    "text": "This section contains many pages on accounting. Use the left-side navigation bar to navigate to different pages with more information. Below, a brief introduction to accounting is provided.\n\n\nOverview of Accounting\nWhen investors look to invest in a firm, they need to know how the firm is doing. Is the business profitable? Does it have enough funds to pay off its obligations? Accounting is the process of producing accounts to answer these questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three types of businesses in accounting.\n\nSole trader: a small business owned and managed by the same person. This person is legally responsible for all of the losses of the business. Sole trader firms are not as heavily regulated in terms of accounting.\nPartnership: a business owned and managed by two or more people. For example, accountancy and law firms. Each partner is a sole trader for accounting purposes, and a partnership is a collection of sole traders acting together in a business. Thus, they are jointly liable for any losses the business makes.\nCompany: a company is not always owned by the managers of the business (directors), but instead, by shareholders who buy shared in the company and elect the directors to run the company. Companies have limited liability: the shareholders are not responsible for the losses of the company, and the company is a separate legal entity. Companies are more heavily regulated in terms of accounting standards.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main statements used in accounting:\n\nThe statement of financial position, also called the balance sheet, states the assets, liabilities, and equity of the business at a given date.\n\nContains assets, liabilities, and equities.\n\nThe statement of profit or loss, also called the income statement, summarises the results of business transactions during a period.\nThe cash flow statement shows the flows of cash in and out of the business to indicate how much cash the business has on hand to pay off obligations.\n\nBookkeeping is the recording of business and commercial transactions to enable these transactions to be summarised in the above accounting statements.\n\n\n\nAssets, Liabilities, Equity\nThere are three types of accounts in the statement of financial position:\n\nAssets: these are things that the business owns or controls. These are split into non-current and current assets.\n\nNon-current assets are assets a business has that it intends to use for more than one year (often several years) to help them earn profits without selling these assets. For example, land, buildings, machines, patents, vehicles, tools, equipment, and other assets are used by the company long-term to produce profit.\nCurrent assets are ones that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months. These are usually things the business aims to sell in order to generate profits. The most notable assets are inventories, cash, and receivables.\n\nLiabilities: liability is an amount owed by the business. These include loans, delayed payments, and bank overdrafts. Non-current liabilities are payments the firm needs to make in more than 1 year into the future, while current liabilities are liabilities that need to be paid soon.\nEquity (capital): recall that the company and owner are separate legal entities. Thus, if the business puts money into a business, the business owes this money to the owner. Equity is what the firm owes to its owners/shareholders.\n\nOpening capital is the amount which the owners have invested in the business at the start of the year/start of the business.\nCapital injections is the amount the owners have invested in the business during the year.\nProfits are funds generated by the business. Profits are equity (well the part that is not put back/reinvested into the business).\nDrawings are the amounts of funds taken out of the business by an owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are more examples of assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent\nNon-current\n\n\nAssets\nInventory, cash, receivables.\nLand, buildings, plant and machinery, patents, motor vehicles, tools, fixtures and fittings, office equipment, computers, long-term investments, ships, works of art.\n\n\nLiabilities\nTrade payables, bank overdrafts.\nLong-term loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Entry Accounting\nThe accounting equation is assets = liabilities + capital.\n\nOr alternatively, assets - liabilities = capital. We often call assets - liabilities net assets.\n\nThis equation will always hold true for the business. Why? If the business owns something (asset), it must have gotten the money for it somewhere (liabilities or equity).\nThis means for every transaction a business makes, there must be an equal change on both sides of this equation.\nAlternatively, we use debits and credits to express this equation. Debits and credits represent changes in accounts (such as inventory, cash, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAssets\nIncrease\nDecrease\n\n\nLiabilities\nDecrease\nIncrease\n\n\nEquity\nDecrease\nIncrease\n\n\n\nDebits and credits should be equal to each other for each transaction a firm makes.\n\nEx. If the firm buys £10 of inventory (an asset) with cash (an asset), that means debit (increase) inventory by £10 and credit (decrease) cash by £10. Thus, debits and credits are equal.\nEx. If Kevin starts his firm by injecting £1,000 into his firm, he credits (increases) equity by £1,000 and debits (increases) cash assets by £1,000. Once again, debits and credits are balanced.",
