    "text": "This section contains many pages on accounting. Use the left-side navigation bar to navigate to different pages with more information. Below, a brief introduction to accounting is provided.\n\n\nOverview of Accounting\nBusinesses need to interact with other stakeholders.\n\nA business might need a loan from the bank. How does the bank know you will pay back the loan?\nA business might need to purchase supplies from a supplier. How does the supplier know they will get paid?\nAn investor might want to invest in your company? How does the investor know how well your company is doing, and how it is compared to the competitors?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three types of businesses in accounting.\n\nSole trader: a small business owned and managed by the same person. This person is legally responsible for all of the losses of the business. Sole trader firms are not as heavily regulated in terms of accounting.\nPartnership: a business owned and managed by two or more people. For example, accountancy and law firms. Each partner is a sole trader for accounting purposes, and a partnership is a collection of sole traders acting together in a business. Thus, they are jointly liable for any losses the business makes.\nCompany: a company is not always owned by the managers of the business (directors), but instead, by shareholders who buy shared in the company and elect the directors to run the company. Companies have limited liability: the shareholders are not responsible for the losses of the company, and the company is a separate legal entity. Companies are more heavily regulated in terms of accounting standards.\n\n\n\n\nAccounting is a set of standards to record business transactions, allowing comparisons between companies, and for stakeholders to make decisions. It is important the financial information has certain qualities:\n\nRelevance: the financial information is relevant to the decisions that need to be made.\nFaithful Representation: show what really happened with business transactions (accurate/truthful).\nComparable: financial information needs to be comparable to other businesses, or previous/future years.\nUnderstandable: clear and easy to read.\nTimely: up to date\nVerifiable: checked by someone else, like an auditor.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Statments\nThe accounting process takes all of these different business transactions and tries to make them comparable/understandable/relevant by summarising information in 3 statements:\n\nThe statement of financial position, also called the balance sheet, states the assets, liabilities, and equity of the business at a given date (a snapshot in time).\n\nContains assets (what the firm owns), liabilities (what the firm owes to external sources), and equities (what the firm owes to owners/shareholders).\n\nThe statement of profit or loss, also called the income statement, summarises the revenues and expenses during a period.\n\nHelps calculate the profitability of the company.\n\nThe cash flow statement shows the flows of cash in and out of the business to indicate how much cash the business has on hand to pay off obligations.\n\nThe profit/loss from the statement of profit or loss makes its way into the statement of financial position through retained earnings. This makes these two statements connected.\n\n\n\nAssets, Liabilities, Equity\nThere are three types of accounts in the statement of financial position:\n\nAssets: these are things that the business owns or controls. These are split into non-current and current assets.\n\nNon-current assets are assets a business has that it intends to use for more than one year (often several years) to help them earn profits without selling these assets. For example, land, buildings, machines, patents, vehicles, tools, equipment, and other assets are used by the company long-term to produce profit.\nCurrent assets are ones that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months. These are usually things the business aims to sell in order to generate profits. The most notable assets are inventories, cash, and receivables.\n\nLiabilities: liability is an amount owed by the business. These include loans, delayed payments, and bank overdrafts. Non-current liabilities are payments the firm needs to make in more than 1 year into the future, while current liabilities are liabilities that need to be paid soon.\nEquity (capital): recall that the company and owner are separate legal entities. Thus, if the business puts money into a business, the business owes this money to the owner. Equity is what the firm owes to its owners/shareholders.\n\nOpening capital is the amount which the owners have invested in the business at the start of the year/start of the business.\nCapital injections is the amount the owners have invested in the business during the year.\nProfits are funds generated by the business. Profits are equity (well the part that is not put back/reinvested into the business).\nDrawings are the amounts of funds taken out of the business by an owner.\n\n\nEquity can also be defined as how much the owners/shareholders would get if the company sold all its assets, and settled all its liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are more examples of assets, liabilities, and equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent\nNon-current\n\n\nAssets\nInventory, cash, receivables.\nLand, buildings, plant and machinery, patents, motor vehicles, tools, fixtures and fittings, office equipment, computers, long-term investments, ships, works of art.\n\n\nLiabilities\nTrade payables, bank overdrafts.\nLong-term loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Entry Accounting\nThe accounting equation is assets = liabilities + capital.\n\nOr alternatively, assets - liabilities = capital. We often call assets - liabilities net assets.\n\nThis equation will always hold true for the business. Why? If the business owns something (asset), it must have gotten the money for it somewhere (liabilities or equity).\nThis means for every transaction a business makes, there must be an equal change on both sides of this equation. If there is an inequality, this usually indicates some mistake in recording transactions.\nAlternatively, we use debits and credits to express this equation. Debits and credits represent changes in accounts (such as inventory, cash, etc.).\n\nDebits and credits should be equal to each other for each transaction a firm makes.\n\nEx. If the firm buys £10 of inventory (an asset) with cash (an asset), that means debit (increase) inventory by £10 and credit (decrease) cash by £10. Thus, debits and credits are equal.\nEx. If Kevin starts his firm by injecting £1,000 into his firm, he credits (increases) equity by £1,000 and debits (increases) cash assets by £1,000. Once again, debits and credits are balanced.\n\n\n\n\nLimited Companies\nA Limited Company is created when an individual or group incorporates a company as a separate legal identity to themselves. This means owners become shareholders in the company, and the company is a separate company. This is different than a sole trader who is responsible for the company.\nIncorporation changes a few things compared to sole traders in terms of legal requirements regarding accounting and financial statements.\n\nCompanies are required to provide more details in their financial statements. This is because companies tend to have more shareholders, who have a financial interest in the company. This does not apply to sole traders, who themselves own the business.\nSole traders legally only need to file accounts for tax purposes. Limited companies must maintain financial records and file them with authorities. In the UK, they must be filed annually with companies house.\nPublic companies (who are traded on the stock market) must make financial statements publicly available for anyone to read.\nCompanies need to prepare statements regarding changes in equity.\n\nAnother terminology difference is capital/equity. Sole traders hold capital in their companies, while shareholders in a limited company hold equity.\nThe actual financial statements may differ as well between sole traders and companies:\n\nIn the income statement, companies report tax expenses, but sole traders do not report tax expenses. This is because for a sole trader, the company is not a separate legal entity, so the sole trader files their own tax return. As a result, limited companies will have a profit before tax and net profit on their statement.\nIn the income statement expenses, limited companies must more clearly report expenses grouped by headings, such as “distribution costs”, “advertising costs”, or “administrative expenses” for example. Sole traders do not need to go into this detail.",

    "text": "The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.\n\n\nOverview\nThe income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit. Revenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).\n\nFrom revenue, a number of things are subtracted:\n\nThe cost of sales, or cost of goods sold (COGS) are subtracted from the revenue to obtain gross profit. COGS is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\nThen, from gross profit, we further subtract operating expenses to obtain operating profit (profit or loss from operations). Operating expenses are a wide range of costs that are neccesary to run the business, such as rent, wages, electricity bills, telephone, research and development, etc.\nThen, from operating profit, we subtract finance costs to obtain net profit before tax. finance costs are expenses that are needed for financing arrangements, such as interest from loans/overdrafts.\nFinally, from net profit before tax, we subtract tax expenses to obtain net profit.\n\nThe net profit (or loss) is then added (or subtracted) to the retained earnings account within the capital/equity section of the balance sheet. This is usually balanced by assigning the profit/loss to the cash asset account.\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, or Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\n\nFor example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the reported revenue, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes in inventory.\n\nTo calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the formula:\n\nCOGS = opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory\n\nThis accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.",

    "text": "Overview\n\n\n\nComposition of Equity\nFor companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:\n\nRetained Earnings: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.\nShare Capital: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.\n\nFor example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.\nThis capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as shares. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.\nThis initial share price (ex. £1) is called the Par Value or Nominal Value, and will never change, no matter the market value of the share.\n\nShare Premium: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.\n\nLets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.\nShares cannot be issued below the par value.\nLets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.\nSince the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a share premium of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.\nThe remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.\n\n\n\nStatement of Changes in Equity\nThe statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.\n\nIt lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).\nThen it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.\nThe closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.\n\n\nThus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.",
