    "text": "This page covers the basics of assurance, ethical codes, and obtaining/accepting an assurance engagement. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Assurance\n\nElements of Assurance\nAssurance is when an independent professional (auditor) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the “quality”/state of the firm. This assurance given by the independent professional assures investors and stakeholders of the accuracy of the information, allowing them to make choices.\nThere are three parties in any assurance engagement:\n\nPractitioner: the auditor or independent professional.\nResponsible Party: the firm/company that is being audited. Typically, we focus on the directors of this firm/company.\nIntended User: typically stakeholders such as shareholders, investors, banks, or anyone needing to know details about a firm’s financial performance.\n\nAssurance can take many different forms:\n\nStatutory Audit: the auditing of financial statements, governed by accounting standards and reporting regulations.\nSustainability Assurance: the auditing of a firm’s sustainability figures and reports.\nOther assurance engagements, such as due diligence before performing transactions, internal controls assessment, fraud investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and Limitations of Assurance\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nIndependent scrutiny of the business by experts, which adds credibility to the firm’s financial statements.\nCan help deter the appeal of fraud for those in the firm.\nDraws attention to issues, such as ethical issues or weaknesses of internal controls.\nReduces risk of management bias.\n\nLimitations:\n\nAssurance does not provide 100% assurance for accuracy, since you cannot possibly test and check every transaction made by a firm (especially large firms).\nCannot solve potential issues of collusion fraud between auditors and companies.\nFinancial information often includes subjective matters, such as depreciation and provision for doubtful debts.\nMay rely on some sub-optimal evidence, such as management representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Assurance\nUsually, when considering the accuracy of financial statements, auditors are concerned with materiality.\n\nA mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMateriality, Error, and Fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, for a $10 billion net profit business, a $1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a $1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.\nThe threshold of materiality is often set at some percentage of net income before tax (ex. 5%) or revenue (1-2%).\nThere is also a distinction between Error and Fraud. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is intentional: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of an engagement, the auditor needs to write an opinion on the level of assurance they can assure regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. There are two levels of assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable Assurance\nLimited Assurance\n\n\n\n\nHigh level of assurance of accuracy, but not absolute.\nModerate/low level of assurance of accuracy.\n\n\nConclusion expressed positively.\nConclusion expressed negatively.\n\n\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements show a true and fair view.\n\n\nNothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial information is not true and fair.\n\n\n\nUsed in statutory audits.\nUsed in all other engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expectations Gap\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers and the public often misinterpret audit opinions to mean other things. This “expectation” of the public contrasting with what audit opinions actually claim is called the expectations gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\nReality\n\n\n\n\nThe public often thinks the auditor detects all fraud and error.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors test 100% of transactions.\nThis is not true, most audits sample transactions to test.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the accuracy of financial statements.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the company will continue to survive for the forseeable future.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides an opinion of the accuracy of financial statements. The financial statements themselves can paint a good or bad picture, the auditor only cares if it is accurate.\n\n\nThe public often thinks the balance sheet shows the true value of the company.\nThis is not true, valuation is done by separate teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Requirements\nIn the UK, all companies are required to legally undergo a statutory audit of their financial statements every year, unless they meet a set of exemption criteria. This requirement and the exemptions are set by the Companies Act 2006.\nTo qualify for an exemption, a firm must not be an insurance, banking, or listed company. In addition, they must also meet two of the following exemption critera below:\n\nFirms that are in banking, insurance, or listed on a stock market must always undergo a statutory audit, even if they meet the criteria above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemption After 6 April 2025 (2/3)\nExemption After 1 January 2016 (2/3)\n\n\n\n\nLess than 50 employees on average.\nLess than 50 employees on average.\n\n\nLess than £7.5m in total assets.\nLess than £5.1m in total assets.\n\n\nLess than £15m in turnover.\nLess than £10.2m in turnover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Assurance\nSustainability is about meeting he needs of the present, without compromising the future from meeting their own needs. Sustainability consists of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\nAbout the planet. For example, emissions and pollution.\nAbout the people. Diversity, inclusion, worker health, mental health, etc.\nAbout company practices and ethics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of growing demand from users for information regarding sustainability, assurance is needed to ensure that the reported sustainability metrics of a firm are accurate.\nCurrently, sustainability assurance and reporting is still a developing field, but several regulations already exist.\n\nIFRS ISSBCompanies Act 2006 (UK)TCFD (UK)CSRD (EU)Assurance\n\n\nIFRS sustainability and disclosure standards are issued by the International Susstainability and Standards Board (ISSB). Their 4 key objectives are:\n\nDevelop standards for a global baseline of sustainability disclosures.\nMeet the information needs of investors.\nEnable companies to provide sustainability information to global capital markets.\nTo facilitate interoperability with disclosures that are jurisdiction-specific, as well as aimed at broader stakeholder groups.\n\nThey consist of two standards:\n\nIFRS S1: General requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information.\nIFRS S2: Climate-related disclosures.\n\nNote: ISSB do not have power to enforce these standards, and they are not legally required for companies (except in Brazil).\n\n\nThe strategic report within the Capanies Act includes some mandatory sustainability reporting requirements.\n\nReporting of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, including sustainability risks.\nInformation about environmental, social, and community matters, employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters.\nInformation about gender diversity within the company.\nClimate related financial disclosures, such as management of climate-adjacent risks and opportunities.\n\nThese are required reporting for firms in the UK.\n\n\nThe TCFD (Task force on climate-related financial disclosures) is a set of recommendations issued in 2017, recommending the reporting of:\n\nGovernance\nRisk Management\nStrategy\nMetrics and Targets.\n\nIn the UK, the TCFD recommendations are mandatory for listed companies. This is not the case in all countries.\nIFRS S2 reporting standards are based on these TCFD recommendations.\n\n\nThe European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect in 2023. It requires the following:\n\nDisclosure about a company’s sustainibility related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\nDisclosures to be reported in the annual report of a company.\nRequires companies to seek assurance over their sustainability disclosures.\n\nAll companies that have securities listed on an EU stock market must follow these directives. Any EU companies that are large (more than 250 employees, 50 million euro revenue) that are not listed must also follow the directives.\n\nNon-EU companies which generate more than 150 million in the EU that also have a EU listed subsidiary must also follow the directives. But this only comes into affect in 2028.\n\n\n\nThe international standard on sustainability assurance (ISSA) 5000 general requirements for sustainability assurance engagements was released in 2024. It provides a framework for how sustainability assurance is to take place.\nThe objectives of the ISSA 5000:\n\nThe obtain reasonable assurance or limited assurance about whether the sustainability is free from material mistatement.\nTo express a conclusion on the sustainability information through a written report that conveys a audit conclusion, and describes the basis for the conclusion.\n\nThe EU CSRD also has guidelines on how to obtain limited assurance for sustainability based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and also provides a provision to move towards reasonable assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Ethics\n\nEthical Codes\nRegulatory bodies set the rules for auditors and the auditing process. There are a few main regulatory bodies in the UK:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales)\nSets the code of ethics for member auditors/accountants. The ICAEW code is based on the internal code of ethics established by the IESBA.\n\n\nFRC (Financial Reporting Council)\nOversees auditors, sets the ethical standards for audit work, and supervises corporate governance and financial reporting bodies. The FRC also has a professional oversight function.\n\n\nIESBA (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants)\nDevelops the international code of ethics for auditors/accountants, which serves as the foundation for the ICAEW ethics code.\n\n\nRecognised Supervisory Bodies\nOrganisations like ICAEW that supervise auditors, and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards. These bodies work together to set, monitor, and enforce ethical standards, ensuring public trust in audits/auditors.\n\n\n\nThe ethical codes that these bodies set can be divided into two types:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule-Based Codes\nSet out specific, detailed requirements, like a checklist of what is and isn’t allowed. Ex. no gifts over £30.\n\n\nPrinciple Based Codes\nFocus on broad principles that guide behaviour for a wide range of professional situations. They focus more on professional judgment rather than spelling out rules for every possible scenario. Ex. no gifts that could impair your objectivity (no specific max value). This is used by the ICAEW and IESBA, since they are more flexible and adaptable to new situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthical Principles\nICAEW’s ethics code is mostly principle-based, but also has some specific rule-based codes for specific things. There are 5 fundamental ethical principles for ICAEW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrity\nBe honest and straight forward.\n\n\nObjectivity\nTo not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to affect your business judgment.\n\n\nProfessional Competence and Due Care\nMaintain your skills and knowledge to provide a competent service, and act in accordance with professional standards.\n\n\nConfidentiality\nRespect confidentiality of information, do not disclose without proper authority.\n\n\nProfessional Behaviour\nComply with rules and regulations, avoid conduct that would discredit the occupation.\n\n\n\nIndependence is key to objectivity. Independence of mind is the ability to make decisions free from bias or influence. Independence in appearance is avoiding situations that may make a third party doubt your impartiality, even if you are already not biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Independence\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence is not necessarily threatened if auditors use the client’s services, given the prices/services the auditors are using are also available to the public.\n\nEx. Auditors can have mortgages with a bank they are auditing, as long as those mortgages and rates are publicly available, and the mortgage was obtained prior to the engagement.\nHowever, if the bank, after learning of the auditor’s appointment, provides favourable mortgages to the auditors and only the auditors, then it is a conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Biases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring Bias\nTendency to use an initial piece of information, which subsequent information is assessed.\nSay an item was $50, but now is on sale for $30. $30 might still be an overpay, but in the context of the original price, it seems cheap.\n\n\nAutomation Bias\nTendency to blindly trust output generated from automated systems.\nBlindly trusting the output from accounting software.\n\n\nAvailability Bias\nPutting more weight on experiences that easily come to mind.\nWe tend to think of plane crash news stories far more than the millions who have safe plane journeys.\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\nDisregarding information that does not fit our existing beliefs.\nCommon in politics.\n\n\nGroupthink\nTendency for groups to reach a conclusion without critical reasoning.\nSocial media like Reddit.\n\n\nOverconfidence Bias\nOverestimating one’s own abilities.\nIf you are experienced, you might not check your work as carefully and assume it is correct.\n\n\nRepresentation Bias\nAssuming the interactions/experiences you have are representative of all people.\n\n\n\nSelective Perception\nExpectations influencing personal views.\nIf you expect something to be bad, you are more likely to look for the bad parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats and Safeguards\nThere are several common threats to ethical behaviour:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat\nDescription\nSafeguards\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Interest Threat\nWhen you have a financial or personal interest that may affect your judgment/bias. Ex. owning shares in a company you are auditing, or one client making up a large proportion of fees for your auditing firm.\n\nMake sure no audit team members have shares.\nNo accepting gifts unless they are very small in value.\nListed company’s audit fees should make no more than 10% of the audit firm’s income, and needs to be disclosed if it exceeds 5% (Add 5% to thresholds for non-listed companies).\n\n\n\nSelf-Review Threat\nWhen you are in the position of reviewing your own work, or work by your team, previously did. Ex. auditing financial statements that you yourself produced.\n\nAccounting services can only be offered to the client if the services and audit are 2 separate teams, and work is mechanical/technical.\nTax calculations and valuations cannot be offered by the audit firm if the client is listed.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy Threat\nWhen you promote a clients position to a point where your objectivity is compromised. Ex. representing a firm in a legal dispute, yet also auditing them.\n\nAudit firm is not allowed to promote, deal in, or underwrite a client’s shares.\nAudit firm cannot provide legal services in a legal case to the client.\n\n\n\nFamiliarity Threat\nHaving a long standing or close relationship with the client, making you more sympathetic to them. Ex. you are auditing a company which has your best friend as financial director.\n\nAudit rotation: for listed companies, lead partner of audit must be changed every 5 years (can extend to 7 years in exceptional circumstances), and cannot return for 5 years.\nAudit employees with personal relationships with client should not be on audit team.\n\n\n\nIntimidation Threat\nWhen you are deterred from acting objectively by external pressures. Ex. the client threatens to replace you as auditor if you do not provide favourable audit conclusion.\n\nIf partner of audit firm joins client, the firm should resign as auditor, and cannot take the audit for 2 years.\nAudit employees with personal relationships with client should not be on audit team.\n\n\n\nManagement Threat (UK Only)\nWhen you or your firm that influences client management decisions, and your interests become aligned with the client management. Ex. you do consulting services for a client that influences their management decisions, then you audit them.\n\nUse the engagement letter to limit the involvement of the audit firm away from management decisions.\nRegulations meaning providing consultant services means cannot be auditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Protection (GDPR)\nGeneral Data Privacy Regulations (GDPR) in the UK and EU restrict the way auditors can collect and store data.\n\nAuditors (and anyone) who processes personal information must ensure it is protected.\nIndividuals hve a right to access their personal data, and information on how it is being processed.\nIndividual data can only be held if the individual has opted in, or there is a specific legal duty.\n\nDisclosure of information is divided into two ways: right to disclose and duty to disclose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight to Disclose\nDuty to Disclose\n\n\n\n\nYou have the option to disclose private information if the following conditions apply.\nYou must disclose private information if any of the following conditions apply.\n\n\n\nClient has given permission.\nDisclosure is in the “public interest”.\nTo defend the firm in a negligence claim.\n\n\nSuspicions of money laundering.\nSuspicions of criminal activity.\nQuality review or investigation of a professional/regulatory body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgreeing an Engagement\n\nObtaining an Engagement\nThere are several ways to get clients for an audit engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTender\nA client needs an auditor, and opens up a bidding process where multiple audit firms present offers. The client will then select an auditor.\n\n\nAdvertise\nUsing advertisements to get clients.\nNote: you must stick to ethical guidelines. This includes not discrediting the profession - meaning you cannot claim you are better than other audit firm in quality, or that another firm does a poor job.\n\n\nRecommendation\nA client of yours recommends your audit firm to another firm. They then become your client.\n\n\n\nHowever, before you agree to be the auditor, ensure that a few things have been met:\n\nEnsure that you are professional qualified to act as an auditor.\nEnsure there are no legal or ethical reasons for you to not be the auditor.\nEnsure you have adequate resources (staff, budget) to complete the audit.\nIf there is a previous auditor, the current practitioner must communicate with them, and determine if there are any reasons not to accept (like ethical concerns). Permission must be granted by the responsible party for this communication, but if this permission is denied, the audit is almost always refused by the practitioner.\n\n\n\n\nAudit Engagement Letters\nAfter accepting an engagement, an engagement letter (contract) needs to be set up. his engagement letter should include:\n\nThe extent of the auditor and management’s responsibilities.\nThe scope of the engagement, and the objectives of the audit.\nThe form of the reports that will be issued, and what reporting framework.\nLevel of access to books and records for evidence.\nRestrictiosn on the auditor’s liability (if possible).\nFees and how they are calculated.\n\nThe audit engagement letter serves as a contract that will minimise misunderstanding and ensure all parties know their roles in the audit.",

    "text": "This page covers information on current assets (such as inventory) and non-current assets (such as ppe). The content in this section is a part of the Accounting Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nInventory\n\nInventory Bookkeeping\nWhen buying inventory, we do not update the inventory account. For a transaction that increases inventory, we instead use the purchases account.\n\nDr Purchases £–\nCr Cash/Payables £–\n\nHowever, at the end of the year, we need to know the closing inventory balance for both the balance sheet, and the calculation of cost of sales. Closing inventory consists of:\n\nGoods which have been purchased, bur not yet sold.\nGoods which are not part of ‘cost of goods sold’ (see adjustments and accrual accounting).\nAn asset of the business, or held for resale and are classified as a current asset.\n\nThe following sections will discuss how to value the closings inventory. At the close of the period, we will complete this transaction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Closing Inventory (Asset)\nThis is an asset on the balance sheet, and will be the value of the inventory listed.\nThis figure will also become the opening inventory of the next period.\n\n\nCr Closing Inventory (Expense)\nThis is a (negative) expense account on the income statement. It will be used alongside purchases and the previous period’s closing inventory to calculate cost of sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory and Service Organisations\n\n\n\n\n\nSome service based industries will have very few physical inventory. For example, netflix or financial services have very few inventory.\nInstead, cost of sales will reflect the cost of providing the service to customers. This includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect Labour Costs\n\nIf you are offering a tax specialist to a company, their salary would be included in cost of sales.\nIf you are a pool cleaning company, then the pool cleaner should be included in the cost of sales.\nSee note below.\n\n\n\nMaterials Used\n\nIf you are offering a pool cleaning company, then the pool cleaning chemicals would be included in the cost of sales.\nNote the difference between expenses (recurring) and one-time purchases of non-current assets (like equipment).\n\n\n\nSales Commission\n\nThe commission or bonus earned by salespeople, specifically as a result of securing work from customers.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: costs incurred that are not directly related to the service are not included. For example, receptionists and their salary, the sales-persons team and their salary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory Count\nAt the year end, the closing inventory is counted. This determines what inventory (what products, how many of each) we have remaining at the end of the year. There are 3 types of inventory: raw materials, works in progress, and finished goods (most common).\nOften, you will not perform an inventory count/valuation on the exact date of the year end. For example, the year might end on 31 December, but the inventory count might not occur until 3rd January.\nThus, we need to account for the changes in inventory between 31 December (Year End) and 3rd January (Count Date) to accurately determine the contents of the inventory on the year end. The adjustment is as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Adjustment to Count} & = \\text{counted inventory (on count date)} \\\\\n& = - \\text{goods received from suppliers (between year end and count date)} \\\\\n& = + \\text{goods sold to customers (between year end and count date)} \\\\\n& = + \\text{goods returned to suppliers (between year end and count date)} \\\\\n& = + \\text{goods returned by customers (between year end and count date)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThese adjustments “undo” the changes that occur between the year end and count date, to properly reflect the inventory on the year-end date.\n\n\n\nCost and NRV\nOnce we have counted what inventory we have, we need to value them so we can add it to the balance sheet, as well as calculate cost of sales. inventory can be valued in two main ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost (most common)\n\nIn cost valuation, inventory is valued at the cost of which the inventory was obtained.\nCost includes the actual inventory purchase price, import duties, delivery fees for the inventory from the supplier to you.\nIf you are converting raw materials into finished products, the cost of this production is also included in the cost valuation.\n\n\nEx. I bought inventory for £500, with a £50 delivery fee.\nThus, under cost valuation, the inventory would be valued at £550.\n\n\n\nNet Realisable Value (NRV)\n\nIn net realisable value (NRV), inventory is valued at the price it can be sold at.\nThe costs needed to enable the sale (ex. repairs, modification costs, selling costs) are deducted from the price the inventory can be sold at.\n\n\nEx. the inventory I have can be sold on the market at £500. I will need to make some modifications of £50 to make this sale.\nThus, under NRV, the inventory would be valued at £450.\n\n\n\n\nOn the balance sheet, inventory should be valued at the lower of either cost valuation or NRV valuation. This is part of the prudence principle: that we should underpromise and overdeliver.\n\nThis valuation at the lower of either cost or NRV occurs on a product by product basis.\nFor example, if you have 3 products A, B, and C. Products A and B have lower NRV valuations, and C has a lower cost valuation. Thus, you should value A and B with NRV, and C with cost.\n\nCost valuation is typically more common. This makes sense: companies usually look to profit off of inventory sales, so unless a good is damaged, out of fashion, or perished, etc., it is unlikely to have a NRV lower than cost.\n\n\n\nValuation Methods\nLet us say you have adopted cost valuation for your inventory. But there is an issue:\n\nImagine you are a company selling footballs. At the beginning of the year, you purchase 100 footballs for your inventory for £1/each. Then a few months later, you purchase 50 more of the same type of footballs for £1.5 each. Now you have 150 footballs. You sell 50 of them (they are all the same, so you just take 50). You have 100 left. But how much is each remaining football worth? £1.5? £1? £1.36?\n\nThere are 3 main ways of valuing inventory based on cost (however, LIFO is not allowed under most international standards).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst in First Out (FIFO)\nFIFO assumes that when you sell the 50 (or however many) products, you are selling the inventory that you purchased first.\nSince you are selling the inventory you purchased first, the closing inventory is mostly the products you purchased last. Thus, valuation is more based on the later purchase prices.\n\n\nAverage Cost (AVCO)\nAVCO assumes you just randomly sell 50 (or however many) products.\nSince you are selling a random amount of products, we value the closing inventory as some sort of weighted average of purchase prices.\n\n\nLast in First Out (LIFO)\nLIFT assumes that when you sell the 50 (or however many) products, you are selling the inventory that you purchased last.\nSince you are selling the inventory you purchased last, the closing inventory is the products you purchased first. Thus, valuation is more based on the older (possibly outdated) purchase prices.\n\n\n\nLIFO is not allowed under IFRS standards, because it often revolves around valuaing invnetory on outdated old prices. This means that it will underestimate the closing inventory (if assuming inflation).\nFor more details on FIFO and AVCO, see below.\n\n\n\nFirst in First Out (FIFO)\nFIFO assumes that when you sell the 50 (or however many) products, you are selling the inventory that you purchased first. Thus, the remaining inventory are the things you purchased most recently.\nFor example, take this purchase history:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase\nUnits\nPrice\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\n20 Units\n£1/unit\n\n\nFebruary\n20 Units\n£1.5/unit\n\n\nMarch\n20 Units\n£2/unit\n\n\n\nIf our closing inventory at the end of the period had 30 units, we would value them as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits\nPurchase\nPurchased Price\nTotal cost\n\n\n\n\n20 Units\nUsing latest purchase (March)\n£1/unit\n£20\n\n\n10 Units\nUsing next latest purchase (February)\n£1.5/unit\n£15\n\n\n30 Units Closing Total\n\n\n£35 Closing Inventory Value\n\n\n\nSimply, we go backwards from the last purchase, forwards in time until we account for the total number of units in the closing inventory.\n\n\n\nAverage Cost (AVCO)\nAVCO assumes you just randomly sell 50 (or however many) products. Since you are selling a random amount of products, we value the closing inventory as some sort of weighted average of purchase prices.\nWe should calculate the Average Cost of all purchased products before each sale occurs. The procedure is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nEvent\nUnits\nUnit Price\nTotal Price\nAverage Cost Before Sale\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\nOpening Inventory\n100 Units\n£1.5/unit\n£150\n\n\n\nFebruary\nPurchase\n400 Units\n£2/unit\n£800\n\n\n\nBefore Sale 1 Total\n\n500 Units\n\n£950\n£950/500 = £1.9\n\n\nMarch\nSale 1\n(100 Units)\n(£1.9/unit)*\n(£190)\n\n\n\nAfter Sale 1 Total\n\n400 Units\n\n£760\n\n\n\nApril\nPurchase\n200 Units\n£3/unit\n£600\n\n\n\nJune\nPurchase\n200 Units\n£4/unit\n£800\n\n\n\nBefore Sale 2 Total\n\n800 Units\n\n£2160\n£2160/800 = £2.7\n\n\nJuly\nSale 2\n(300 units)\n£2.7/unit*\n(£810)\n\n\n\nAfter Sale 2 Total\n\n500 Units\n\n£1350\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that after all transactions have occurred, our closing inventory has 500 units, with a total value of £1350. That is our valuation.\n\n*Note: the sale unit price is the average cost before sale calculated prior to each sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation\n\nDepreciation Basics\nLet’s say you have a non-current asset, like a machine, that you will use for multiple years in order to help create profits. There are two things that are important to note:\n\nThe non-current asset undergoes wear and tear, meaning that after using it for a few years, it is not in as good condition as it was originally as purchased. We may want to reflect this fact in our financial statements.\nWhen we use a non-current asset over multiple years to generate profits, based on accrual accounting, we should match the expenses to the income. Thus, we might not want to record the purchase price of a non-current asset all in one year, and instead, match some expenses of the non-current asset to the revenues it is generating over its useful life.\n\nDepreciation addresses these two issues by issuing annual depreciation expenses. These expenses occur each year during the useful life of a non-current asset (NCA), and account for the wear and tear and use of the asset.\nThere are a few key terms in depreciation that are important to know:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Cost\nThe cost at which the non-current asset was purchased. This is what is originally recorded in the transaction to purchase the NCA (Dr. NCA, Cr. Cash/Payables).\n\n\nUseful Life\nThe amount of time (in years usually) that the NCA can be expected used to generate revenues. This is not necessarily when the firm will replace it (firms often replace NCAs before the useful life has elapsed).\n\n\nResidual Value\nAfter the useful life of the NCA has passed, what will the remaining NCA be able to be sold for? That is the residual value.\n\n\nCarrying Amount\nThe carrying amount is the value of the NCA minus all the previous depreciation expenses incurred on it. It is the “value” of the asset after accounting for wear and tear and use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation Expenses\nAs noted, in depreciation of a NCA, we charge a depreciation expense annually. Thus, at the end of every year, we make the following transaction in our accounting records:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Depreciation Expense\nIncreases the depreciation expense account.\nResets to 0 after every year (like an expense account).\n\n\nCr Accumulated Depreciation\nA liability (negative-asset) that decreases the value of the non-current asset.\nAccumulates (does not reset) its balance every year. Thus, it measures the total reduction in the value of the NCA after multiple years.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to calculate the annual depreciation expense to charge.\n\nStraight LineReducing Balance\n\n\nStraight line depreciation charges the exact same depreciation expense for every year. The calculation of the annual depreciation expense using straight line is:\n\\[\n\\text{straight line annual depreciation} = \\frac{\\text{purchase cost} - \\text{residual value}}{\\text{useful life}}\n\\]\nSometimes, straight line depreciation is given in percentage format. An \\(X\\) percent straight line depreciation implies an annual depreciation expense of:\n\\[\nX \\% \\ \\text{straight line annual depreciation} = X\\% \\times \\text{purchase cost}\n\\]\nNote: typically (especially with straight line), depreciation is calculated monthly. Thus, if an asset is bought in the middle of the year, and is undergoing straight line depreciation, it may only undergo half of the annual depreciation expense that year.\n\n\nReducing balance depreciation charges different expenses every year (higher in the earlier years of the useful life). The calculation of reducing balance depreciation is:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{depreciation \\ charge \\ for \\ year} \\ n = \\mathrm{carrying \\ amount} \\times X\\%\n\\]\nWhere \\(X\\%\\) is given as the annual depreciation rate for reducing balance, and carrying amount is the purchase cost minus accumulated depreciation.\nSince reducing balance changes its expense every year, you can also quickly calculate it for any year \\(n\\) after the purchase year:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{depreciation \\ charge \\ for \\ year}\\ n = \\mathrm{carrying \\ amount} \\times (X\\%)^n\n\\]\nNote: \\(X\\%\\) is a decimal between 0 and 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisposals\n\nProfit or Loss\n\n\nDisposal Transactions\n\n\nParts Exchange Allowance",

    "text": "Statement of Changes in Equity\nFor companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:\n\nRetained Earnings: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.\nShare Capital: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.\n\nFor example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.\nThis capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as shares. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.\nThis initial share price (ex. £1) is called the Par Value or Nominal Value, and will never change, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an ordinary share.\n\nShare Premium: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.\n\nLets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.\nShares cannot be issued below the par value.\nLets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.\nSince the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a share premium of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.\nThe remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.\n\nThe statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.\n\nIt lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).\nThen it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.\nThe closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.\n\n\nThus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.\n\n\n\nAccounting Errors\nThere are 5 main types of errors:\n\nErrors of omission: forgetting to include a transaction in the accounts.\nTransposition errors: when an accountant accidentally swaps the positions of digits in an entry. For example, instead of £3,850, they record it as £3,580.\nErrors of principle: when an accountant records a transaction that breaks the rules/standards of accounting.\nErrors of commission: when an accountant records a transaction in the correct large account but wrong sub-account. For example, they correctly choose asset/liability/equity, but put it in the wrong account. The most common is recording one expense as another.\nCompensating errors: when two are more errors offset each other, resulting in a correct balance for all accounts, but the individual errors are still there.\n\nTo correct errors, we should take a few steps.\n\nIdentify the incorrect entry. Note the values included in this incorrect entry.\nDecide what the correct entry should be. Note the values included in this correct entry.\nCompare the result of the first two steps, and create a journal entry to fix the error. This journal entry should correct the account balances from the incorrect entry to the correct entry. We do not withdraw the old entry, just a new entry to correct the difference.\n\nSuspense accounts are a way to avoid errors in the first place. Sometimes, you know one account for the entry debits/credits, but you are not sure about another. Thus, instead of putting the unknown side of the transaction into a wrong account, you can put it into a temporary account called a suspense account. Later, you can correctly record the transaction.",

    "text": "This page contains the basics of accounting, including the different financial statements, accounting principles, and reporting standards. The content in this section is a part of the Accounting Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nAccounting Concepts\n\nFinancial Statements\nSummarising transactions: this provides information about the company to stakeholders. Stakeholders can include shareholders, investors, employees, banks, or any users that may interact with the company. This takes the form of 4 financial statements:\n\nBalance SheetIncome StatementCash FlowsChanges in Equity\n\n\nThe statement of financial position (balance sheet) reflects the position of a business at a specific point in time. This includes the assets (the things the company owns), the liabilities (what the company owes), and the equity (the investment in the company).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Assets\nNon Current Assets\nTotal Assets\n£–\n£–\n£–\n\n\nEquity\nCurrent Liabilities\nNon-Current Liabilities\n£–\n£–\n£–\n\n\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n£–\n\n\n\nSee the accounting equation for more details on assets, equity, and liabilities.\n\n\nThe statement of profit or loss (income statement) reflects the performance (profitability) of a business over a period of time (usually a year). It starts with the revenue of the year, then subtracts different revenue expenditures until we reach the net profit figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n£–\n\n\nless Cost of Sales\nGross Profit\n(£–)\n£–\n\n\n(less) Operating Expenses\nOperating Profit\n(£–)\n£–\n\n\nFinance income (bank interest)\n(less) Financing Expenses\nProfit before Tax\n£–\n(£–)\n£–\n\n\n(less) Tax Expenses\nNet Profit\n(£–)\n£–\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statement of cash flows shows how cash is entering and exiting the business over a period of time. Useful to see if the company has enough cash to pay off short term loans/liabilities.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in equity shows how equity (stock/shares) are changing in a business over a period of time. Useful to see how the company is issuing shares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Businesses\nThere are several types of businesses, that will affect the reporting standards and legal liability of businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSole Trader\nA business owned and operated by one person. Common with small businesses.\nThe owner is personally liable for any losses.\nSole traders legally only need to file accounts for tax purposes.\n\n\nPartnership\nA business owned and operated by a joint number of partners (a collection of sole traders). Common with law and accountancy firms.\nThe partners are personally liable for any losses.\nPartnerships legally only need to file accounts for tax purposes.\n\n\nCompany\nA business that is a separate legal entity. It is owned by shareholders, who elect directors to run the business.\n\nLimited Liability Companies (LLC): privately owned, no trading shares.\nPublic Limited Company (PLC): publicly owned, shares are traded.\nLimited Liability Partnerships (LLP): a partnership that is a separate legal entity.\n\nLimited liability - the shareholders are not personally liable for losses.\nCompanies are required to provide more details in their financial statements. These accounts must be provided to Companies House.\n\n\nNot-for-Profit\nCharities, clubs and societies, and government/public sector organisations (ex. NHS).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Liability\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen saying personal liability, this means people can have their personal belongings repossessed to pay off the debts of a business.\n\nA person’s private car and house can be taken away.\n\nIn limited liability, only the money the person invested can be lost. Their personal belongings are not at risk even if the company is in debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Entity Concept\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matter the type of business, their financial statements should only include transactions related to the business. This is the business entity concept - the business is a separate entity (even if legal liability is not separate).\n\nEx. most sole traders should have a separate account for personal and business matters. Personal matters should not be included in the financial statements.\nIf a sole trader needs to pull things in and out of a business, they invest capital into the business (equity increase), or draw from the business (equity decrease).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples and Conventions\nThere are a set of principles that characterise good financial information and reporting, and a set of conventions for accounting standards:\n\nAccounting PrinciplesAccounting Conventions\n\n\nThese are the principles that make up good financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevance\nInformation should be useful, and has the ability to influence decisions of users. It helps users confirm past predictions, and helps users assess the future of the business. Non-material things are not very important.\n\n\nFaithful Representation / Reliabiility\nInformation in the statements should represent reality correctly and accurately. Information should be neutral, free from bias, and free from errors. No speculation, just what is there.\n\n\nComparability\nInformation should be reported in a similar manner (with same methods) for different firms over the same time period to allow for comparisons between firms. They should also be reported similarly between years to allow for trend analysis.\n\n\nVerifiability\nThe information should be able to be verified to be accurate (generally through an audit), and has evidence to back up the assertions.\n\n\nTimeliness\nInformation should be available quickly to influence decisions - info should not be delayed so that it is out-of-date.\n\n\nUnderstandability\nInformation should be expressed clearly and according to standards so it is understood.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting is a set of standards to record business transactions, allowing comparisons between companies, and for stakeholders to make decisions. It is important the financial information follows certain conventions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvention\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nHistoric Cost\nWe should report things at historic cost: the cost at acquisition. Current valuations are subjective and can change.\nIf a firm bought a property for £50m, it should be listed as £50m.\n\n\nPrudence/Conservatism\nWe should be conservative in making judgmenets. Under-promise (don’t overstate profits/good things, always state even potential bad things like losses and liabilities).\nIf a firm has a reasonable chance of incurring a liability, we should notify investors of this ahead of time. However, we should not notify investors of good news (profits) before they are realised.\n\n\nMoney Measurement\nIn general, financial statements should include things that can be valued in monetary terms. This is to avoid subjectiveness.\nThings like favourable geographic location cannot be given a monetary value, so are at risk of being inflated by management.\n\n\nMatching\nExpenses should be matched to the revenues they generate.\nIf we sell a car this period, but haven’t yet received the payment, we should still match the expense of the car to this sale this period.\n\n\nGoing Concern\nWe report statements, with the assumption that the business will continue operations for the foreseeable future. If this isn’t the case, we should recommend to not use going concern.\nIf Microsoft is suing a small firm that will cease operations if they lose, and the firm has a 95% chance of losing, it is reasonable to notify investors about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting Equation\nThe accounting equation is the following equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity \\(\\implies\\) Assets - Liabilities = Equity\n\n\nAssetsLiabilitiesEquity\n\n\nAssets are things the company owns, that helps it generate profit. They are divided into current assets and non-current assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Assets\nAssets you plan to liquidate (turn into cash, move around, sell) within the next 12 months as part of making business.\nInventory, Cash, Cash at bank, Trade Receivables (things customers need to pay to you), Prepayments.\n\n\nNon-Current Assets\nAssets you do not plan to sell/move on from in the next 12 months, but still help generate profit.\nProperty Plant Equipment, Fixtures, Vehicles, Factories, Computers, Capital Expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities are things the company owes to external lenders. For example, money they owe to the bank or suppliers. They are divided into current and non-current liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Liabilities\nThings you owe to external lenders that are due within 12 months.\nShort Term Borrowings, Trade Payables (things you need to pay), Provisions, Overdrafts.\n\n\nNon-Current Liabilities\nThings you owe to external lenders that are due in more than 12 months.\nBank Loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity is the investment of the shareholders of the company. Equity consists of the following accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares/Capital\nThe direct investment of shareholders/owners. This includes share premium and share capital (discussed later).\nShare Premium, Share Capital, Injections\n\n\nRetained Earnings\nThe accumulated profits/loss of the business. Each new year profit is added/subtracted from it.\nRetained Earnings.\n\n\nDrawings\nWhen the owners take out money. This can be a sole trader taking a computer out to give to their kid, or dividends issued to shareholders.\nDividends, Drawings.\n\n\n\nBased on the above, we can determine the ending equity of a period is:\n\n(Ending) Equity = Injection of Shares + Opening Equity + Profit - Drawings\n\n\n\n\nThe accounting equation is always true: the statement of financial position’s listed assets, liabilities, and equity should always equal/balance.\nThis equation implies the duality concept: that every transaction that affects one side of the equation, must also affect the other side of the equation, in order to keep the accounting equation true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Assets\n\n\n\n\n\nNet assets are defined as:\n\nNet Assets = Assets - Liabilities\n\nNet current assets are defined as:\n\nNet Current Assets = Current Assets - Current Liabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\nThere are two main types of expenditures accounts that are also important to note, since these go on different financial statements:\n\nCapital ExpenditureRevenue Expenditure\n\n\nCapital expenditure are expenses used to acquire long-term assets, or to improve or enhance the earning capacity (not maintenance, only improvement) of long term assets you already hold.\n\nEx. Purchasing a factory is acquiring a long-term asset.\nHowever, painting it or repairing it is not enhancing the earning capacity, only maintaining it.\n\nCapital expenditures are included in non-current assets in the statement of financial position.\n\n\nRevenue expenditure is incurred for either:\n\nPurchases for trade purposes, such a raw material, inventory (cost of goods sold), operating expenses (wages, rent, administrative), tax expenses (see below).\nTo repair/maintain a non-current asset. For example, repairing the roof of a factory is a revenue expenditure, not a capital expenditure.\n\nRevenue expenditure is classified into expenses on the statement of profit or loss. However, since the net profit is added to retained earnings in the equity section of the balance sheet, it is also indirectly in the balance sheet.\n\n\n\nRevenue Expenditures are divided further into these expense accounts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\nThe cost of purchasing the inventory that was sold to generate the revenue in the accounting period.\nCan be calculated as: opening inventory + purchases - closing inventory.\nEx. Cost of inventory/goods sold.\n\n\nOperating Expenses\nThe expenses involved in operating the business day-to-day outside of cost of sales.\nEx. wages, rent, utility bills.\n\n\nFinance Expenses\nExpenses needed for finance/loan arrangements.\nEx. interest payments.\n\n\nTax Expenses\nExpenses needed to pay taxes owed.\nEx. Tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Judgement\n\n\n\n\n\nMany figures in financial statements are derived from the application of judgment in applying accounting concepts. This means different people can reach different conclusions.\n\nExample: determining whether expenditure is revenue or capital.\nOther examples: valuation of buildings, depreciation, etc.\n\nRefer to the International Ethics Standards Borad for Accountants (IESBA) and the ICAEW code of ethics, and their ethical principles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits and Credits\nWe know from the accounting equation, there is a duality concept. Another way to specify this concept is with debits (Dr) and credits (Cr). They are just fancy ways to say increase and decrease. Importantly, debits and credits do different things for different accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAssets (all)\n🔺\n🔻\n\n\nLiabilities (all)\n🔻\n🔺\n\n\nGeneral Equity (Share capital, share premium, injections)\n🔻\n🔺\n\n\nExpenses (negative equity)\n🔺\n🔻\n\n\nDrawings/Dividends (negative equity)\n🔺\n🔻\n\n\n\nThe debits and credits of each recorded transaction should balance. See the preparing financial statements to see how we turn debit and credit records into financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookkeeping Basics\n\nRecording Transactions\nFor each transaction, we should list the debits and credits, and ensure they are equal. Then, we put each debit/credit entry into their respective accounts (like cash, inventory, etc.). These respective accounts are called T-accounts/ledger accounts. This process is called double entry accounting.\nFor example, imagine I invest £5,000 into the firm’s bank account. In double entry accounting, we know the debits and credits are:\n\nDr. Cash (Asset) £5,000\nCr. Equity (Equity) £5,000\n\nThen, list the debits and credits in the correct accounts. Each transaction’s debits and credits should balance. However, each t-account individually does not need to be balanced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n£0\n£5,000\n\n\n\nCash (Asset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n£5,000\n£0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: for income statement accounts (revenue, purchases, expenses), the starting balance of all accounts at the beggining of the period should be reset to 0. For all other accounts (on the balance sheet), the starting balance of debits/credits should be carried over from the previous period.\nFor more details on specific types of transactions, see the left sidebar for details.\n\n\n\nClosing the Accounts\nAt the end of the year, we need to close the accounts (except inventory and cost of sales, see above). The steps are as follows:\n\nSum up each side of debits and credits. Find the side (debit or credit) with the higher sum value. Put this at the bottom of both sides:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n£1000\n£600\n\n\nhighest: £1000\nhighest: £1000\n\n\n\n\nLook at the side with the lower value. Find the “difference” between the lower and higher values, and put it on the side of the lower side. This difference is called the balance carried forward (c/f). Write it on the smaller side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n£1000\n£600\n\n\n-\nhighest: £1000\nbalance c/f £400\nhighest: £1000\n\n\n\n\nOn the side with the larger value, copy the balance c/f value to that side on the very bottom, called the balance brought forward (b/f).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebits\nCredits\n\n\n\n\n£1000\n£600\n\n\n-\nhighest: £1000\nbalance b/f £400\nc/f £400\nhighest: £1000\n\n\n\n\nThe balance b/f is the final balance of the account. This final balance (note if it is a debit or credit) will go into the trial balance.\n\nFor income statement accounts (revenue, purchases, expenses), the starting balance will be reset to 0 for the next year.\nFor balance sheet accounts (all not on the income statement), the balance b/f will be starting balance for next year’s accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrial Balance\nA trial balance is simply a list of all accounts, and their closing balances. It takes the form of the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr £\nCr £\n\n\n\n\nCash\n3,000\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n4,000\n\n\nRent Expense\n3,000\n\n\n\nCapital\n\n2,000\n\n\nTOTAL\n£6,000\n£6,000\n\n\n\nThe trial balance should balance: the total number of debits and credits should be equal.\n\nMake sure you put the value of the account into the correct column (debit or credit).\nA quick way to check if the column is correct, is that revenue should always be in the debit column (you cannot have negative revenue, and debit increases revenue), and expenses/drawings should always be in the credit column.\n\nThis trial balance will help us create both the income statement, and the balance sheet.\nNOTE: before you continue on to compiling statements, you will need to check if there are adjustments to be made. Adjustments are to correct for accrual accounting procedures, and include accrued payments/prepayments.\n\n\n\nIncome Statement\nTo create the income statement from the trial balance, we just simply put the closing balances of the relevant accounts into the following form. More details on income and expense accounting are on the income accounting page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr £\nCr £\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n\n£–\n\n\nCost of Sales\nGross Profit\n£–\n\n\n\nRent Expense\nSalary\nOther Operating Expense\nOperating Profit\n£–\n£–\n£–\n\n\n\nFinance Expense\nProfit Before Tax\n£–\n\n\n\nTax Expense\nNet Profit\n£–\n\n\n\n\nThe bolded parts are not accounts, and should be left blank until all accounts are filled in. Then, to calculate the bolded metrics, sum up all the credits, and all the debits, above the bolded metric (all the way to the top). Then do the sum of credits minus the sum of debits.\n\n\n\nBalance Sheet\nTo compile the balance sheet, simply list the remaining non-income statement accounts into their proper location. Remember that for assets, debit is positive and credit is negative. For liabilities and equity, debit is negative and credit is positive. More details on assets are provided on the asset accounting page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Current Assets\n\nAccounts go here\n\nCurrent Assets\n\nAccounts go here\n\nTotal Assets\n-\n\n£–\n\n-\n\n£–\n\n£–\n\n\nEquity\n\nShare Capital, Premium, Drawings\nRetained Earnings*\n\nNon-Current Liabilities\n\nAccounts go here\n\nCurrent Liabities\n\nAccounts go here\n\nTotal Equity + Assets\n-\n\n£–\n£–\n\n-\n\n£–\n\n-\n\n£–\n\n£–\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash Flow Statement\nSince the income statement (and net profit/loss) is recorded with accrual accounting, it does not record when cash is received/leaving a business. However, cash is still important as cash is needed to pay suppliers and liabilities.\nThe cash flow statement records how cash flows in and out of a business. It is divided into 3 parts:\n\nCash flow from operating activities: this includes cash flows from core business operations, such as from sales, COGS, and operating expenses.\nCash flow from investing activities: this includes cash flow from the purchase and disposal of assets.\nCash flow from financing activities: this includes cash flows from liabilities/equity (loans, shares) and dividends.\n\nThere are two ways to prepare a cash flow statement.\n\nDirect method: this is basically recording and counting all the inflows and outflows of cash.\nIndirect method (more common): it uses different details from the income statement and balance sheet to work out the cash flow. Essentially, it is undoing the accruals/prepayments and payables/receivables to calculate cash flow.\n\n\nCash flow from operating activities:\n\nStart with the profit before tax figure from the income statement.\nAdd finance costs (so if you spend £X on finance costs, do + £X).\nSubtract finance income (so if you earn £X in finance income, do -£X).\nSubtract profits from disposal of non-current assets (so if you earn £X, do -£X, and if you lost £X, do +£X).\nAdd depreciation expense (so if you spent £X on depreciation costs, do +£X).\nAdd amoritsation expense (so if you spent £X on amoritsation, do +£X).\nSubtract change in inventory (so if inventory increased from last period, subtract. If inventory decreased from last period, add).\nSubtract change in trade receivables (so if receivables increased from last period, subtract. If receivables decreased from last period, add).\nAdd change in trade payables (so if payables account increased from last period, add. If payables account decreased, subtract).\nAdd change in accruals (so if accruals account increased from last period, add. If accruals account decreased, subtract).\nSubtract tax expense (so if you spent £X on tax, do -£X).\nSubtract interest paid (so if you spent £X on tax, do -£X).\n\nCash flow from investing activities\n\nSubtract amount spent on property, plant, and equipment (so if you spent £X, do -£X).\nSubtract amount spent on intangible assets (so if you spent £X, do -£X).\nAdd proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment (so if you gained £X, do +£X).\n\nCash flow from financing activities\n\nAdd proceeds from issue of shares (so if you gained £X, do +£X).\nAdd change in borrowings.\nSubtract dividends paid (so if you paid £X, do -£X).",

These are important for recording transactions correctly, as well as providing evidence to auditors/regulators about the accuracy of accounting records.\nThe most common source documents relate to the sales of the business, and the purchase of inventory.\n\nSales DocumentsPurchase Documents\n\n\nThe below are common documents during the sales cycle, where you sell a good to a customer. They are listed in order of appearance during the sales process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales Order\nRecord of the order the customer wants, detailing the goods required.\n\n\nGoods Delivery Note (GDN)\nWhen delivery to the customer is sent, a goods delivery note is also produced. This is the record that the goods were dispatched.\nThey are also often known as dispatch notes.\n\n\nSales Invoice\nSales invoice is the document sent to the customer as a request for payment, including the goods provided and the payment required.\nUpon creation of the sales invoice, the firm will input the record of this sale into the accounting records.\n\n\nCredit Note\nA credit note is sent to the customer if they have been overcharged, or have returned their notes. Basically a I-owe-you from the company to the customer.\nWhen issued, a record will be entered into the accounting records.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below are common documents during the purchase cycle, where you buy a good from a supplier. They are listed in order of appearance during the purchase process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Order\nRecord of the order we want from the supplier. This is sent to the supplier.\n\n\nGoods Received Note (GRN)\nWhen we receive the goods from the supplier, we produce a goods received note. This is a record that the goods were accepted into inventory successfully.\n\n\nPurchase Invoice\nPurchase invoice is the document sent by the supplier as a request for payment, including the goods provided and the payment required.\nUpon receiving the purchase invoice, the firm will input the record of this purchase into the accounting records.\n\n\nDebit Note\nA debit note is sent to the supplier if we need to return goods or have been overcharged. Basically a You-owe-us from the company to the supplier.\nWhen issued, no changes will be done. The debit note is not a source document. Only until we receive the credit note from the supplier will we input accounting entries and use it as a source document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: debit notes (for purchase returns/overcharged) are not a source document per-se. They are a request for the credit note, which is then considered a source document.\n\n\n\nAccounting Ledgers\nA business will have many transactions, so accounting is usually done with software to manage records. These software systems will have different “modules” (parts), that each perform different functions. Below are a few of the most common:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal Ledger\n\nThe nominal ledger, also known as the general ledger, is the normal ledger of different accounts (sales, cash, capital, etc.) that we record transactions in.\nThese ledgers might be more “general”. For example, you will have a trade receivables and trade payables account, however, you will not list the individual details on a transaction basis (like who the receivables are owed from, and who the payables are owed to. They will all be classed as trade payables/receivables).\n\n\n\nReceivables/Payables Ledger\n\nThe nominal ledger only includes general trade receivables/payables as an account. However, a business needs to be able to know which customers owes it money, and which suppliers it owes money to.\nThese individual customer’s receivables/payables are recorded in a receivables or payables ledger, with each ledger containing different customer/supplier accounts for each customer/supplier.\nWhen a sales invoice and credit notes are recorded, the accounting software system will update the trade receivables/payables account in the nominal ledger. They will also update a customer’s/supplier’s individual ledger account.\nThe receivables ledger in total should have the same balance as the trade receivables account on the nominal ledger, and this can be used as a way to check/reconcile balances.\n\n\n\nNon-Current Asset Register\n\nThis register (spreadsheet) is a list of all individual non-current assets the business owns. It also contains details on each item’s purchase costs, accumulated depreciation, depreciation expenses, and depreciation policy.\nThe non-current asset register is useful to check the depreciation of the nominal ledger, as well as reconcile with the nominal ledger. It can also be used as a checklist for checking the existence of non-current assets when performing an audit.\n\n\n\nPayroll Module\n\nThis module processes wages and salaries of employees. It specifies each employee’s gross salary, tax deductions, national insurance deductions, and employer contributions.\nThis can be used to ensure all employees are properly paid, as well as check the balances of the payroll expenses on the nominal ledger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessing Transactions\nThere are 3 stages in processing transactions with a accounting software system: inputs, accounting system processes, and outputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) Inputs\n\nWe input documents into a system to start processing transactions.\nThis can include source documents for purchases/sales (invoices, credit notes).\nThis can also include standing data: data that will be used over and over again for transactions. Ex. payroll module with PAYE codes and banking details. These will be used every time salary is paid.\n\n\n\n2) System Processes\n\nSystem processes can be either real-time (transactions processed as inputs of the transactions are input), or in batches (the inputs are recorded but processes might not be run until the end of the day).\nCalculations: the system will take standing data and data inputs, and compute the require calculations. Ex. it may take payroll module data and timesheet data to calculate how much to pay an employee who has worked a certain amount of hours, as well as the proper tax and national insurance deductions.\nLedgers: ledger accounts will be automatically updated for inputs.\nJounral Entries and adjustments: adjustments such as accruals, prepayments, depreciation, may be calculated and processed.\n\n\n\n3) Outputs\n\nOutput could be in the form of a trial balance. This can often be extracted at any point in time.\nOutput could also be generated in the form of reports. These reports can show a variety of things, such as the age of debts, summary statistics, list of large transactions, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud Accounting Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud accounting systems have become quite common: where these processes and data are stored online, and the software is maintained by the provider. This allows users to access the software and data via the internet.\nTypes of cloud services for accounting include:\n\nSoftware as a service: software applications hosted in the cloud, that users can access (ex. Gmail).\nPlatform as a service: Provides virtual space for customers to host and develop their own applications (Ex. Azure).\nInfrastructure as a service: data storage, back-up services (ex. Amazon Web Services, OneDrive).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReporting Standards\nThere are two main types of reporting standards firms should follow in the UK:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Standards\n\nInternational accounting standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nIssues by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\nUK Companies must still comply with UK company Law (Companies Act of 2006) in terms of reporting obligations.\n\nListed companies must use international standards.\n\n\nUK GAAP\n\nUK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP).\nIssued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and governed by UK Company Law (Companies Act of 2006).\n\nNon-listed companies can choose to use UK GAAP or International Standards.\n\n\n\nThe two standards do have slight differences in terminology:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Standards\nUK GAAP\n\n\n\n\nNon-Current Assets\nFixed Assets\n\n\nProperty Plant Equipment (PPE)\nTangible Assets\n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash at bank and in hand\n\n\nInventory\nStock\n\n\nCarrying Amount\nNet Book Value\n\n\nReceivables\nDebtors\n\n\nAllowance for Receivables\nProvision for Doubtful Debts\n\n\nIrrecoverable Debt\nBad Debt\n\n\nLoan Notes\nDebentures\n\n\nPayables\nCreditors\n\n\nRevenue\nTurnover\n\n\nFinance Costs\nInterest Payable\n\n\nRetained Earnings\nRetained Profits\n\n\n\nThe balance sheet is also in a slightly different order. In international standards, equity comes above liability. This is reversed in UK GAAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nReconcilliation and Errors",

    "text": "This page contains steps on how to prepare key account related to items on the income statement, such as revenue and expenses, and how their transactions are recorded. The content in this section is a part of the Accounting Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nSales Bookkeeping\n\nCost of Sales\nIn every accounting period, a firm generates revenue/sales. The cost of sales is the cost of the inventory that generated the revenue/sales of that period.\nCalculating the cost of sales is typically done with the following equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Cost of Sales} = \\text{Open Inventory} + \\text{Purchases} - \\text{Returns} - \\text{Close Inventory}\n\\]\n\nOpen inventory is the opening inventory balance at the start of the period. It is also the closing balance of inventory from the last period.\nPurchases are the value of purchases in the time period (including inward delivery costs).\nReturns are the value of the purchases that were returned to the supplier.\nClose inventory is the value of the inventory at the end of the period (valuation techniques are in the Inventory and NCA page).\n\nA few key notes on this equation:\n\nFor valuing the closing/opening inventory balance, see the asset accounting page.\nPurchase value includes all costs associated with getting the inventory into your hands. This includes delivery fee for delivery from supplier to you, and import duties.\nWhen purchasing new inventory, they should be recorded as Dr Purchases (Expense account), Cr Cash/Payables. Do not record transactions with inventory as an account - inventory is only counted and valued at the end of periods.\n\n\n\n\nReturns and Discounts\nDuring business, you will often encounter returns and discounts. The accounting of returns and discounts depends on if they apply to you and your customer, or you and your supplier.\n\nReturnsDiscounts\n\n\nThe recording of sales (selling to a consumer) and purchases (buying from a supplier) are typically done as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales (selling to customer)\nPurchases (buying from supplier)\n\n\nDr Cash/Expenses (increase)\nCr Revenue (increase)\nDr Purchases (increase)\nCr Cash (decrease) / Cr Payables (increase)\n\n\n\nHowever, sometimes, the consumer (or us) will want to return a good. For returns, we simply “undo” the transaction with the reverse record:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales (selling to customer)\nPurchases (buying from supplier)\n\n\nDr Revenue (decrease)\nCr Cash (decrease)\nDr Cash (increase) / Dr Payables (decrease)\nCr Purchases (decrease)\n\n\n\nSometimes, some companies will have a separate expense account for returns (so instead of Dr Revenue, they would Dr Returns).\n\n\nFor discounts, we initially record what you expect to receive/pay (including likely discounts). However, you may need to go back and adjust this. This is because of early settlement discounts: a discount for paying early after you have received the good.\n\nEx. I buy materials on credit for 6100. The supplier offers a £5 discount if you pay within 10 days. If I do pay off within 10 days and get the discount, this may require adjustment in the books.\nNote: if your expectation of discount is actually come true, then no adjustment is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially\nOnce Paid\n\n\n\n\nSales\n(selling to customer)\nDr Receivables (expected price)\nCr Revenue (expected price)\nCr Recievables (expected price)\nDr Cash (actual paid price)\nCr/Dr Revenue (different to balance dr/cr)\n\n\nPurchases\n(buying from supplier)\nCr Payables (expected price)\nDr Purchases (expected price)\nDr Payables (expected price)\nCr Cash (actual paid price)\nCr/Dr Purchases (difference to balance dr/cr)\n\n\n\nThe same applies to initially expecting a discount but failing to get it. In some standards (UK GAAP), instead of Cr/Dr purchases, we Cr/Dr a separate account - discounts, to make the adjustment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayroll Expense\nWhen a firm pays its employees, it has to pay 3 things:\n\nPay the employee’s income tax to the tax collector (HRMC in the UK).\nPay the employee’s national insurance contribution (and the employer’s additional contribution) to the tax collector.\nPay the employee the remaining net salary.\n\nThe net income to the employee is paid immediately (such as at the end of the month), but the tax and national insurance is usually withheld until tax filling season.\nThe transaction would be as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Wages (Expense)\ngross wages + employer national insurance\nThis expense covers net salary, income tax, and employee + employer national insurance contribution.\n\n\nCr Cash (Asset)\nnet wages\nThe cash of net income that is paid out to the employee.\n\n\nCr Tax Payable (Liability)\nincome tax + employee and employer national insurance\nTaxes are paid at the end of the year, so there is a liability for income tax and national insurance.\n\n\n\nWhen the tax is later paid to the tax authority (HMRC), the liability is reduced (debited) and cash is decreased (credited).\n\n\n\nDelivery Expense\nThere are two types of delivery expenses that might be incurred, which have to be recorded differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivery Inwards\nDelivery Outwards\n\n\n\n\nDelivery costs and expenses to deliver products from suppliers to your inventory.\nDelivery costs and expenses to deliver products from your inventory to customers.\n\n\nThis will be included/added as an expense within the cost of sales.\nThis is a separate expense in the operating expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMargin and Markup\nMargin and markup are two relationships between the sales, cost of sales, and gross profit. They often inform companies and investors about the profitability of a firm.\nMargin is the ratio of the gross profit to sales (revenue):\n\\[\n\\text{margin} = \\frac{\\text{gross profit}}{\\text{revenue}}\n\\]\nMarkup is defined as the ratio of the gross profit to sales, and can also be determined by a ratio of sales to cost of sales:\n\\[\n\\text{markup} = \\frac{\\text{gross profit}}{\\text{cost of sales}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 1 + \\text{markup} = \\frac{\\text{sales}}{\\text{cost of sales}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrual Accounting\n\nMatching Principle\nThe matching principle is that we attribute/match expenses to the revenue they help generate. For example, the bills for this year helped generate next year’s revenue, would actually be considered a bill for next year, since the revenue was earned in the next year.\nHowever, because of accruals and prepayments, the payment of bills may not be in the same period as the revenue they helped generate. The same ideas apply to income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrued Payments\nYou have received a good/service this period, but you will not pay for the good/service until next period.\nThe utility company has provided you water this year, but you will not pay for it until next year. This should be an expense for this year.\n\n\nPrepayments\nYou will receive a good/service next period, but you have already paid for it this period.\nYou will get office to use next year, but you have already paid for it this year. This should be an expense for next year.\n\n\nAccrued Income\nYou have earned revenue from a transaction this period, but you will not be paid until next period.\nIncome that you earned this year by building a house, but you will not bill/be paid for the work until next year.\n\n\nDeferred Income\nYou will earn revenue from a transaction next period, but you have already been paid this year.\nIncome that you will earn by providing a magazine next year, but you have already been paid this year.\n\n\n\nAcrruals basis of accounting means that to calculate the profit for the period, we need to include all the income and expenditure relating to the period, whether or not the cash has been received or paid, or whether or not an invoice has been issued.\n\n\n\nPayment Adjustments\nFor accrued payments and pre-payments, adjustments are necessary.\n\nAccrued ExpensePrepayment\n\n\nLet us say you receive a water service for 2024, but payment of the water bill is due in 2025. In 2024, you will originally not record anything, because you have yet to pay. However, you received the service/good for 2024, so the expense needs to be recorded in 2024.\nThus, at the year end in 2024, you make the following adjustment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Expense\nThis is the expense for water service in 2024. This will be on the income statement for 2024.\n\n\nCr Accrued Expenses (Liability)\nThis is a liability - to show that you owe the water company for their service in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period.\nThis account can also be called “other payables”.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, as soon as the year begins, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr Expense\nReverse the accrued payment. You will essentially have a negative expense balance to start the year, since the expense account is set to 0 every new period.\n\n\nDr. Accrued Expenses (Liability)\nReverse the accrued payment from the carry-forward last year.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, once you have paid the water bill for 2024, you will have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Expense\nWill cancel out the original Cr Expense.\n\n\nCr Cash\nYou decrease cash to pay the liability.\n\n\n\nYou will do the same for accrued expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.\n\n\nLets say you have a water utility service for 2025, but you paid in 2024. This expense is for 2025, but because payment was in 2024, you have to adjust this so the expense is correctly allocated to 2025.\nThus, at the year end in 2024, you make the following adjustment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr Expense\nSince the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this expense.\n\n\nDr Prepayments (Asset)\nThis is an asset - basically a receivables showing you have already paid for the service, and the utility company “owes you” the service.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, as soon as the year begins, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Expense\nAdd the expense to this year (2025).\n\n\nCr Prepayments\nReverse the prepayment from the carry-forward last year.\n\n\n\nYou will do the same for prepayment expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.\n\n\n\nYou can do partial adjustments. For example, you pay rent for Nov 2024 to Aug 2025 in Nov 2024. You would need no adjustment in the 2024 accounts for Nov and Dec 2024, but Jan 2025 to Aug 2025 would be a prepayment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Expenses Quickly for Income Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick way to calculate the expenses of a year for the income statement, when you are only given cash payments are:\n\nexpenses on income statement = total cash amount paid for expenses in this period\n+ closing accrued expenses of this year - closing accrued expenses from last year\n+ prepayments closing from last period - prepayments closing for this period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Adjustments\nFor accrued or deferred payment, adjustment is necessary.\n\nAccrued IncomeDeferred Income\n\n\nLet us say you have delivered a product in 2024, you will only be paid in 2025. Because the product was delivered in 2024, the income is for 2024, even though the payment occurs in 2025, so you have to adjust this so the revenue is correctly allocated to 2024.\nThus, at the year end in 2024, you make the following adjustment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr Revenue\nThis is the revenue for product in 2024. This will be on the income statement for 2024.\n\n\nDr Accrued Income\nThis is a asset - to show that your customer owes you for a product in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period.\nThis account can also be called “other receivables”.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, as soon as the year begins, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Revenue\nReverse the accrued income. You will essentially have a negative revenue balance to start the year, since the revenue account is set to 0 every new period.\n\n\nCr Accrued Income (Asset)\nReverse the accrued income from the carry-forward last year.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, once you have paid the water bill for 2024, you will have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr Revenue\nWill cancel out the original Dr Revenue.\n\n\nDr Cash\nYou gain cash as the customer pays you.\n\n\n\nYou will do the same for accrued income in 2025 paid in 2026.\n\n\nLets say you will deliver a product in 2025, but you were paid in 2024. This revenue is for 2025, but because product delivery was in 2024, so you have to adjust this so the revenue is correctly allocated to 2025.\nThus, at the year end in 2024, you make the following adjustment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Revenue\nSince the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this revenue.\n\n\nCr Deferred Income (Liability)\nThis is a liability - because you owe the customer a product of this value.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, as soon as the year begins, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCr Revenue\nAdd the revenue to this year (2025).\n\n\nDr Deferred Income (Liability)\nReverse the deferred income from the carry-forward last year.\n\n\n\nYou will do the same for prepayment expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.\n\n\n\nYou can do partial adjustments. For example, if you are building a house between Oct 2024 and Aug 2025, and payment is following the entire job. The parts you have already built (delivered) between Oct 2024 and Dec 2024 are revenue from the previous year, and should be adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating Expenses Quickly for Income Statement\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick way to calculate the expenses of a year for the income statement, when you are only given cash payments are:\n\nrevenue on income statement = total cash amount paid for revenue in this period\n+ closing accrued income of this year - closing accrued income from last year\n+ deferred income closing from last period - deferred income closing for this period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebts and Allowances",

    "text": "Internal controls are the policies and procedures put in place by management of a firm to comply with regulations and produce reliable financial statements. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nInternal Controls\n\nSystems of Controls\nInternal controls are systems implemented and maintained by the management of a company (internally), to ensure financial reporting is reliable and accurately, the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulation.\nA good control system has a few principles:\n\nControls must be designed to address specific risks. For example, unauthorised payments or errors in financial reporting.\nControls should be implemented and operated consistently, not just on paper.\nControls need to be monitored and updated as risks and business processes change.\n\nExamples of controls include:\n\nQuality control can prevent the production of poor quality goods.\nCredit control can limit the level of bad debts\nControls over inventory can prevent running out of inventory and ensure optimal levels of inventory.\nCompliance department can ensure business adheres to relevant laws and regulations.\nControls over payroll ensure salaries are paid correctly, avoiding disputes with staff, and avoiding mistakes over payroll taxes.\n\nAuditors care about the internal controls, as it impacts the audit risk, and how we plan for an audit. Thus, auditors often take notes, confirm checklists, and diagram/flowchart internal controls. Walkthrough tests of controls are done to obtain information about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman error or intentional collusion which can bypass systems.\nAbnormal/occasional transactions which may not fit into the control system.\nManagement override.\nInformal nature/lack of documentation, especially in smaller companies.\nLimited number of staff which limits segregation of duties.\nThe costs of controls may exceed the potential risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of Controls\nA company’s control activities are the policies/procedures that help ensure that management directives are carried out. They can be:\n\nPreventative controls: preventing errors from occurring in the first place.\nDetective controls: detecting errors/fraud that have already occurred.\n\nAside for control activities, there are also other aspects of a system of controls:\n\nActivitiesEnvironmentRisk ProcessInformation SystemMonitoring\n\n\nThere are 5 types of different control activities (and an additional one), according to ISA (UK) 315:\n\nAuthorisation and approval (preventative). Example: expenses require authorisation and approval (can be automated)\nReconcilliations (detective): compare two or more data elements (ex. balances), and match the balance (nothing without matching/agreeing the balance is a reconciliation).\nVerifications (detective): verify something with another source of evidence (verify completeness/occurrence, not matching balances like reconciliation).\nPhysical/Logical controls (preventative/detective): physical security (like locks, passwords), checks for the number of documents/invoices (logical true/false).\nSegregation of duties (preventative): assigning different people different parts of the same task, thus requiring multiple people to check/complete and preventing one person from committing fraud alone.\nGeneral IT Checks which check machines work properly (antivirus, testing system processes), while information processing controls are IT versions of verification, reconciliation, and logical controls when dealing with info input.\n\n\n\nThe control environment is the overall attitude, awareness, and actions of management regarding internal controls. This “sets the tone” for internal controls. Good environments can include:\n\nExistence and frequent meeting of an audit committee, and an internal audit function.\nEffective documentation of control systems, importance of controls communicated to all staff, and recruiting only employees integrity.\nNo management override of controls.\n\nAn audit committee (mandatory for listed companies) is a subsection of the board of directors. It has the following characteristics:\n\nAll members must be non-executive directors. The internal audit chief should not sit on the committee, as they are an executive director.\nRequired to have written terms of reference, which includes committee objectives and the format and content of reports to the board of directors.\nOverseas the financial statement, internal audit, and external audit appointments.\n\n\n\nA company’s risk assessment process is a process for identifying and anlaysing business risks.Business risks is a risk that could adversely effect a company’s ability to achieve its objectives and execute its strategies.\n\nBusiness risks can often impact inherent risk, a part of the Audit risk equation.\n\nA risk assessment process should have the following steps:\n\nIdentify relevant business risks, such as changes i noperating environment, new systems, rapid growth (international), new technology.\nEstimate the significance of the risks. Is it high, medium, or low?\nAssess the likelihood of the risk occuring.\nDecide on actions to address the risk.\n\n\n\nA company’s information system and communication shows how information is correctly recorded, stored, and processed to ensure accurate record keeping and reporting.\nThis includes the financial reporting system, and how transactions are recorded and processed. Auditors are interested in things such as:\n\nClasses of transactions (like types/categories they are saved in).\nSystems used to prepare financial systems, such as accounting software.\nAccounting records and information, such as invoices and receipts.\nRoles and responsibilities allocated to staff - who can change things, who can input things, who can view things, and if there are dangers of controls being overridden.\n\n\n\nOngoing or separate evaluations to ensure controls activities are working as intended.\n\nDirectors should assess if they are still adequate, especially when there are changes in the environment and business risks.\nControls should be monitored at all levels.\nInternal audit can test controls, and recommend changes.\nExternal audit can highlight deficiencies during the auditing process, that the directors can take and implement fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Technologies\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand controls, an auditor must understand the technology the organisation is using in its processes, and the associated risks.\n\nRobotic Process Autmoation (RPA) are automated processes that automate tasks based on “if this, then that” instructions. They are common for repetitive tasks. It is important to test if these systems are operating correctly.\nGenerative AI is also being used very commonly. However, we have to be concerned about the biases in AI, data privacy in training data, transparency behind AI decisions, and environmental impacts of AI. There should be controls and procedures to minimise these risks.\nCloud computing and storage, such as online storage or accounting records, are also vulnerable to risks such as data privacy and security, as well as data corruption. There should be controls over these risks, such as password changes and backup policies.\nDigital signatures are also commonly used, but can be forged. Effective control systems will have logs and certificate of completion as controls.\nCybersecurity risks, such as attacks, are also a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue System\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases System\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Audit\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Audit\nInternal audit is an independent function in a firm, responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls.\nInternal auditers do not implement or design controls, as that is the job of management. Instead, they provide assurance to management and the board that controls are working correctly and as intended. The responsibilities of internal audit are:\n\nTesting whether controls are operating effectively.\nReviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.\nChecking compliance with laws, regulations, and company policies.\nRecommending improvements to controls and processes for management to action on.\nAssisting in fraud detection and risk management.\n\nIn smaller firms without an internal audit function, external auditors may perform the role of providing feedback on control weaknesses. However, the responsibility of monitoring (the other functions of internal audit) will be with the firm’s management.\n\n\n\nModern Controls\nAs organisations adopt new technologies, new risks emerge. Modern internal controls address these risks, including cyber security, supply chain management, and digital transformation.\n\nCybersecurity: these risks include human error (ex. weak passwords), fraud and deliberate sabotage, computer malware, DDos attacks. To mitigate these risks, firms often require strong password policies and frequent password changes, firewalls and anti-virus software, and access controls for authorised users only.\nSupply Chain Risks: these risks include disruptions from supplier failure, nature disasters, and geopolitical events. To mitigate these risks, firms can vet and monitor suppliers, maintain alternative suppliers, reviewing supplier contracts regularly, and using tech to track supplies and shipments.\nDigital Transformation: these risks from new tech include overreliance on tech, automation bias, and trusting systems without sufficient review. Controls include regular reviewing and testing of automated processes, maintaining manual checks for critical transactions, and training staff to interpret and question system outputs.",

    "text": "This page covers the general process of assurance and audit engagements, starting from planning, to concluding. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nAudit Planning\n\nPlanning Process\nBefore starting an accepted engagement, there needs to be a plan. This helps preparing the neccesary resources (funding, team size, timeline) of the audit, as well as what areas are potentially higher risk for fraud/error.\nThere are two documents that are needed to plan an audit engagement.\n\nAudit strategy: Determines the scope, timing, and direction of the audit, and shapes the audit plan.\nAudit plan: More detailed, shows how the overall strategy will be implemented.\n\n\nAudit StrategyAudit Plan\n\n\nThe key components of the audit strategy are:\n\nUnderstanding the client, and its environment.\nMaterality threshold. What is considered material?\nRisk assessment. What are the risky areas for potential material misstatement?\nNature, extent, and timing of audit procedures.\nDirection of the audit, who is supervising, and generally how review of the audit work will be undertaken.\n\n\n\nThe audit plan ensures the following:\n\nAttention (in-depth planning) is paid to the most important areas (high risk areas).\nPotential problems/risks are identified early.\nThe audit is properly organised and managed.\nWork is assigned to the appropriate member of the audit team, and team members receive direction and supervision of team members.\nReviews by more senior auditors are planned and facilitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Client\nISA (UK) 315 requires auditors to gain an understanding of the client. This is because it is necessary to understand what areas have higher risk of fraud/error, in order to design an effective audit strategy and plan.\nSpecifically, auditors should understand:\n\nThe industry and regulatory environment of the client, which can help identify risks.\nNature of the client, including the client’s selection and application of accounting policies.\nObjectives and strategy of the client, and related business risks, which may affect the risk of material misstatement.\nMeasurement and review of the client’s financial performance. This could indicate pressure on directors to commit fraud.\nThe strength and effectiveness of internal controls at preventing errors/fraud. If these are weak, the risk of material misstatement is higher.\n\nAuditors also need to understand the client’s financial reporting framework, and its accounting policies.\n\nFinancial Reporting FrameworkAccounting Policies\n\n\n\nWhat are the accounting principles and industry-specific accounting principles.\nReporting of revenue recognition.\nAccounting for financial instruments.\nReporting of foreign currency assets, liabilities, and transactions.\nAccounting principles for unusual or complex transactions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the methods used to recognise, measure, and disclose significant and unusual transactions? For example, foreign transactions.\nHow do they use accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas, where there is a lack of regulation, guidance, or consensus?\nHow do they deal with changes in the environment that may require a change in accounting policies.\nWhat financial reporting standards, laws, and regulations that are new to the client.\n\n\n\n\nTo get this information, auditors can ask the client’s management, conduct analytical procedures, observe processes, and inspect documents and assets.\n\n\n\nAudit Risk\nAuditors do not want to give a wrong opinion, since shareholders/users depend on the auditor’s opinion. Thus, auditors want to lower the audit risk of an incorrect opinion, such as failing to detect fraud/errors.\nThe risk of an audit (audit risk) is calculated as follows:\n\nAudit Risk \\(=\\) Inherent Risk \\(\\times\\) Control Risk \\(\\times\\) Detection Risk\n\n\nInherent RiskControl RiskDetection Risk\n\n\n\nThe client’s risk of error/fraud, which cannot be controlled by auditors. This is usually related to the business/industry/regulatory environment.\nFor example, if the management is under pressure, there is an inherent risk of fraud due to this pressure.\nIf certain items/transactions are new, complex, one-off, or subjective, they are high risk.\n\nPg. 48 see more\n\n\n\nHow strong a client’s internal controls are to detect the inherent risk of error/fraud.\nStronger controls mean less control risk. Weaker controls means higher control risk. This makes sense - weaker controls are more likely to fail to detect errors/fraud.\nAuditors generally cannot control this as well.\n\nSee the internal controls page for more details on how controls work, and how to evaluate controls.\n\n\nThe risk that auditors fail to detect material misstatements. If inherent risk and control risk are higher, auditors need to reduce detection risk to lower audit risk overall.\nTo lower detection risk, auditors can:\n\nIncrease the sample size that they are testing, especially for accounts with high inherent/control risk.\nLower the materiality threshold.\nImprove the quality of evidence to make sure it is sufficient and appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks also exist in relation to climate change. These include:\n\nPhysical Risks: risks from the physical effects of climate change, like extreme weather and storms. For example, dependent on supply chains/stock affected by climate change, such as farming and storms.\nTransitional Risks: Risks relating to shifts to a low-carbon economy, such as changes to policy, regulation, technology, and market.\n\nThese are important because they can affect the financial statements. For example, destroyed assets/inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Parties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA related party is a firm who is influenced, or has influence over the client. For example, company A’s director is married to company B’s (our client’s) company.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with transactions involving a related party. However, they do increase the potential of manipulation between the two parties.\nGenerally, there is the principle of arm’s length: that if the two parties were not related, the transaction’s prices would still make sense.\nRelated party transactions must be disclosed separately, even if arm’s length is met. These are considered material by nature (regardless of the size of the transaction).\nRelated parties can be difficult to identify, and if there is manipulation, these are often concealed from auditors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Materiality\nRecall that a mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\nWhen determining if a transaction/error is material, there are two ways to do this:\n\nMaterial based on the size of the transaction (common thresholds below). This is determined during the planning stage.\nMaterial based on the nature. For example, transactions between the company and its directors must be disclosed, as these are considered material regardless of size. Related party transactions are also material by nature.\n\nIn higher risk businesses, the tolerance level for mistakes is lower, so we set the materiality threshold to the lower end of these ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nThreshold Size\n\n\n\n\nProfit before tax\n5% to 10%\n\n\nRevenue\n0.5% to 1%\n\n\nTotal Assets\n1% to 2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Materiality\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance materiality is an amount set by the auditor lower than the materiality threshold of the financial statements to reduce the risk of a specific account.\n\nFor example, if one branch of a large company is accused of fraud, you might have a special performance materiality for that branch, while the other branches are at the normal threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Materiality\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sustainability assurance, materiality is assessed in a similar way.\n\nISSB sustainability materiality: sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably affect the entity’s prospects that could influence the decisions of users.\nDouble materiality is a concept which considers not only the sustainability issues that reate financial risks for a company, but also the materiality of a company’s impact on people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Procedures\nAnalytical procedures is comparing non-financial information (like expectations based on experience) to actual financial information. Inconsistencies in comparisons may indicate potential risk.\n\nEx. During the pandemic lockdowns, we might assume an airline would have a difficult year, and expect a net loss. If the airline actually has a net profit, that is an inconsistency that could be a result of errors/fraud.\n\nAnalytical procedures are mandatory at planning to identify potential risks, according to ISA (UK) 315. They are also required to be used to assist forming an overall conclusion based on ISA (UK) 520.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Analytical Procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey generally require strong background knowledge and experience of the client, which may be limited if the client is new.\nThey generally require experienced staff to be effective.\nThe quality of the procedure depends on the reliability of the sources.\n\n\n\n\nOften, when comparing in analytical procedures, we will need to use ratios to see how their value or how they have changed, which can be used in the comparison with our expectations.\n\nPerformanceLiquidity/SolvencyEfficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGross Profit Margin\ngross profit \\(\\div\\) revenue\nAssesses profitability before taking operating expenses into account.\n\n\nOperating/Net Margin\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) revenue\nAssess profitability with operating expenses included.\n\n\nCost of Sales Percent\ncost of sales \\(\\div\\) revenue\nHow much costs of inventory make up of revenue.\n\n\nOperating Cost Percent\noperating expenses \\(\\div\\) revenue\nHow much operating expenses make up of revenue.\n\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE)\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) (equity + net debt)\nEffective use of resources.\n\n\nReturn on Shareholder’s Fund\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) (share capital + share reserve)\nEffective use of resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Ratio\ncurrent assets \\(\\div\\) current liabilities\nAbility to pay liabilities due soon with liquid assets.\n\n\nQuick Ratio\n(receivables + cash + current investments) \\(\\div\\) current liabilities\nAbility to pay liabilities due soon with liquid assets.\n\n\nGearing Ratio\n\n\n\n\nInterest Cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nNet Asset Turnover\n\n\n\n\nTrade Receivables Period\n\n\n\n\nTrade Payables Period\n\n\n\n\nInventory Holding Period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Evidence\n\nStandard of Evidence\nISA (UK) 500 requires auditors to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to draw an audit opinion.\n\nSufficient evidence is about quantity. If you have higher risk, you will need more quantity of evidence. If you have lower materiality threshold, the more quantity of evidence is needed. Reasonable assurance will need more quantity of evidence than limited assurance.\nAppropriate evidence is about the quality of evidence. Is the evidence reliable and from third parties? Is the evidence relevant to the financial statement assertions?\n\nThe highest quality form of evidence is either auditor generated or from an independent third party. Original documents are better than copies. Written evidence is better than oral evidence.\nAudit evidence is relevant depending on what we are considering:\n\nTransactions/EventsAccount Balances\n\n\nFor transactions/events, relevant evidence includes:\n\nOccurence: proof that the transaction occurred. For example, actually having the product, or an invoice.\nCompleteness: all transactions that should have been recorded are recorded.\nAccuracy: the amounts of each transaction are accurately recorded. Invoices are useful for this.\nCut-off: transactions are recorded in the correct accounting period.\nClassification: transactions are recorded in the correct accounts.\nPresentation: transactions and events are accurately aggregated, clearly described, and disclosures are relevant and understandable.\n\n\n\nFor account balances, relevant evidence includes:\n\nExistence: assets, liabilities, and equity balances do exist. Physical visits to check assets are common.\nRights and Obligations: the client actually owns the assets, and the liabilities are indeed the obligations of the client. For example, look at purchase records, contact bank for cash account/loans.\nCompletness: all assets, liabilities, and equity are recorded.\nAccuracy, Valuation, and Allocation: assets, liabilities, and equity are at the appropriate amounts.\nClassification: assets, liabilities, and equity have been recorded in the correct accounts.\nPresentation: assets, liabilities, and equity are accurately aggregated, clearly described, and disclosures are relevant and understandable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Stage\nWalkthrough tests begin at the start of the evidence stage. The tests and procedures you will do in the audit will depend on what happens in the walkthrough test.\n\nWalkthrough test will get you a feel of the company.\nIt will help you decide if you expect the controls to be effective, or expect the controls to be ineffective.\n\nThen, your audit evidence stage will depend on which expectation you have.\n\nEffective ControlsIneffective Controls\n\n\nIf you expect effective controls after the walkthrough, the steps you will take will be:\n\nDo strong tests of controls. Note if the tests match your expectation.\nIf controls are found to be effective, you can do limited audit testing due to limitations of any control system.\nIf controls are found to be ineffective, you should conduct full substantive testing.\n\n\n\nIf you do not expect controls to be effective, the steps you will take are:\n\nSkip tests of controls, since we assume they will be ineffective.\nConduct full substantive testing.\n\n\n\n\nYou can do this for each separate account/transaction. For example, if most controls are expected to be strong, but there are certain unusual/complex/one-off transactions, you can apply the ineffective controls assumption to those.\n\n\n\nSubstantive Procedures\nSubstantive procedures are tests with numbers. ISA (UK) 500 sets out the following types of procedures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInspection\n\nExamining records, documents, or physical assets.\nFor example, an auditor could look at an invoice to confirm the cost of inventory.\nThird party documentation (like invoices, certificates) are more reliable than internally created documents.\nInspection can provide evidence regarding the existence of things, the value of things, the rights and obligations (like in a contract), and the completeness of things.\nRemote Auditing Techniques: For example, observing inventory counts through a live video, sharing documents electronically, and interviews via video call.\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nWatching a process or procedure being performed.\nFor example, observe a firm’s staff counting inventory.\nObservation is useful for confirming a process is performed as described.\nHowever, be aware that processes may not be the same when observed vs. unobserved.\n\n\n\nInquiry and Confirmation\n\nRegards asking staff (inquiry) or third-parties (confirmation).\nThis is useful for understanding processes or obtaining explanations.\nConfirmation from third parties (banks, customers) is a strong form of evidence.\nBe aware that oral responses are less reliable than written confirmation.\n\n\n\nRecalculation and Reperformance\n\nChecking the mathematical accuracy of documents and records. This is strong evidence as the auditor does it directly.\nFor example, the auditor recalculates the depreciation to confirm they match the accounts.\nReperformance is similar to recalculation, but not with math. Basically, do the same thing that the firm did previously.\n\n\n\nAnalytical Procedures\n\nLike done in the planning stage.\nIn the evidence stage, if inconsistency of expectations and figures are unacceptable, seek further evidence.\n\n\n\nEstimation Procedures\n\nSome accounts require estimation, such as depreciation, allowance for receivables, and provisions. Since these are subjective, they are at risk of management bias.\nReview and test the process used by management to develop the estimate. Is it reasonable?\nUse an independent expert to make an estimate for comparision with the company’s figure.\nReview subsequent events (events after the year-end) for confirmation of the accuracy.\nTest the operating effectiveness of the controls over how management made the estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Tools\nModern accounting systems use computer software, so using technology to carry out audit procedures is common. There are two ways to use automate tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Data\nAudit Software\n\n\n\n\nCan be used as a test of control.\nUsed for reperformance and recalculation in substantive procedures.\n\n\nAuditor’s data (real or fake) is put into the client’s system. This tests the controls in the system.\nUsing client data (real) into the auditor’s system, to recalculate and reperform transactions. It can also be used to conduct data analysis.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nEnter data with a timesheet with hours outside the normal range to check if the system rejects it.\nEnter a valid purchase invoice to check the system correct allocates the purchase to the correct account.\n\nExamples:\n\nReperformance to check the values in accounts.\nTransaction analysis: matching purchase orders, goods received notes, and invoices.\nAnalytical procedures: analysing revenue trends by product or region.\nJudgemental areas: using sensitivity analysis to test assumptions on the net realisable value of inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectional Testing\nA mistated balance can be overstated (too large) or understated (too low). Generally, the risk is one direction. For example, companies rarely want to understate revenue or overtate expenses.\nTesting for overstated and understated balances is different. For example, if you are testing non-current assests, you have the following sources/accounts/records:\n\nFinancial statements (non-current assets section).\nNon-current asset register (an excel sheet of all non-current assets).\nPhysical assets (the actual non-current assets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Overstatement\nTest Understatement\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with financial statements.\nCheck the non-current asset register. See if it agrees with the financial statement.\nSelect a sample of assets in the non-current asset register.\nPerform physical checks of the sampled assets and confirm they all exist.\n\n\nStart with the physical assets you can see being used in the client’s business.\nSee if these physical assets exist in the non-current asset register.\nIf they are present, check they are also in the financial statements.\n\n\n\nWhy? If assets are overstated, that means some on the financial statements don’t exist in real life. So you start from the financial statements and check they exist.\nWhy? If assets are understated, some assets that are being used aren’t on the financial statements. Thus, start from the physical assets, and check all of them are on the financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Sampling\nIn audit, we almost never check every transaction. We use a subset sample of the transactions to determine if there are material misstatements.\n\nThere are some transactions, such as high-value transactions, which will always be tested. These are not sampled.\n\nThe sampling procedure is as follows:\n\nIdentify the population. If we are auditing receivables, then receivables is our population.\nIdentify sampling unit. If we are auditing receivables, then invoices of credit customer purchases are the unit.\nSelect sample (see below).\nIdentify errors within the sample, and draw conclusions.\n\nThe way we select samples can be of many different ways.\n\nRandom selection: we randomly sample from the population.\nSystematic selection: we randomly select the first unit for the sample, then maintain the same interval between selections. Ex. invoice 5, 10, 15, etc.\nMoney sampling unit: every £1 in the population has an equal chance of being selected. So the unit is actually every £1, not each invoice.\nHaphazard sampling: just taking a sample manually without statistical theory.\n\nHaving a larger sample means lower detection risk, thus lowering the audit risk and creating a higher level of assurance.\nSampling risk is the risk that your sample might not reflect the entire population, leading to incorrect conclusions. For example, if you under-sample transactions that are likely to be fraudulent, you are likely to miss errors/fraud.\n\n\n\nErrors and Mistatements\nOnce an auditor has tested a sample of items, they must draw conclusions both to the sample, but also the entire account population.\nThings to consider include:\n\nThe nature of the errors identified. Are they true misstatements?\nThe cause of the errors identified. Do they all have a pattern - i.e. all of them have messed up VAT? Do they all occur on one day?\nThe impact on other parts of the audit. Does it affect the account balances, or do the errors cancel out? How does it affect the accounting equation.\nThe probable misstatement in the population. Determine how frequently based on the sample, the misstatement will be repeated in the unsampled population. If the total misstatement is material, then additional testing needs to be done.\n\nThe auditor must communicate all misstatements to management, and request they to be corrected, no matter if they are material or immaterial.\n\nIf a client refuses to correct a material error, first understand why management refuses. Double check it is a misstatement. If it is material, you will modify the opinion (implied opinion, see below).\nIf a misstatement is not material, and the management refuses to correct it, you do not need to modify the opinion (but it should be mentioned separately).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisstatements Material in Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nSome categories which are always material, no matter the size, include:\n\nAffect compliance with laws and regulations.\nAffect compliance with debt covenants.\nAffect ratios used to evaluate financial position, results, or cash flows.\nIncrease the management’s compensation (renumeration).\nRelated party transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and Reporting\n\nAudit Opinions\nThe auditor’s report contains two different options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Opinions\nImplied (Modified) Opinions\n\n\n\n\nAlways reported in a final opinion.\nOnly required if a material problem arises.\n\n\nPresents the opinion on the financial statements:\n\nAre they true and fair?\nAre they properly prepared in accordance to accounting standards?\nIs the Information contained in the director’s report and strategic is consistent with the financial statement?\n\nReported under the following situations:\n\nReturns adequate for audit have not been received by branches not visited by the auditors.\nAccounts are not in agreement with the underlying accounting records.\nProper accounting records have not been kept.\nInformation and explanations required for the audit were not received.\nDirectors remuneration disclosures required by law were not made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Report Format\nISA (UK) 700 states the following must be included in the final audit report:\n\nTitle, addressee, and date of report.\nAuditor’s opinion on the financial statements, and basis for opinion.\nKey audit matters (listed companies), such as high risk, significant judgmental items, and significant transactional events.\nManagement and auditor responsibilities.\nExplanation of the extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud.\nGoing concern section, and opinion on other matters (see above).\nAdditional explanations/definitions of an assessment of risks of material misstatement, application of materiality, and overview of the scope of the audit. This is to close the expectations gap.\nName and signature of the engagement partner, and their address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Assurance Reports\n\n\n\n\n\nFor non-audit assurance engagements, a few things need to be included:\n\nIdentification and description of the subject matter (is it sustainability, due dilligence?)\nIdentification of criteria.\nAny inherent limitations which exist.\nAny restrictions upon the purpose/user.\nWork performed in accordance to which set of standards.\nConclusion must be negatively expressed (limited assurance).",
