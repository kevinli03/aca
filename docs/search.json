    "text": "This section contains many pages on assurance and risk. Use the left-side navigation bar to navigate to different pages with more information. Below, a brief introduction to assurance is provided.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Assurance\n\nElements of Assurance\nAssurance is when an independent professional (auditor) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the “quality”/state of the firm. This assurance given by the independent professional assures investors and stakeholders of the accuracy of the information, allowing them to make choices.\nThere are three parties in any assurance engagement:\n\nPractitioner: the auditor or independent professional.\nResponsible Party: the firm/company that is being audited. Typically, we focus on the directors of this firm/company.\nIntended User: typically stakeholders such as shareholders, investors, banks, or anyone needing to know details about a firm’s financial performance.\n\nAssurance can take many different forms:\n\nStatutory Audit: the auditing of financial statements, governed by accounting standards and reporting regulations.\nSustainability Assurance: the auditing of a firm’s sustainability figures and reports.\nOther assurance engagements, such as due diligence before performing transactions, internal controls assessment, fraud investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and Limitations of Assurance\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nIndependent scrutiny of the business by experts, which adds credibility to the firm’s financial statements.\nCan help deter the appeal of fraud for those in the firm.\nDraws attention to issues, such as ethical issues or weaknesses of internal controls.\nReduces risk of management bias.\n\nLimitations:\n\nAssurance does not provide 100% assurance for accuracy, since you cannot possibly test and check every transaction made by a firm (especially large firms).\nCannot solve potential issues of collusion fraud between auditors and companies.\nFinancial information often includes subjective matters, such as depreciation and provision for doubtful debts.\nMay rely on some sub-optimal evidence, such as management representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Assurance\nUsually, when considering the accuracy of financial statements, auditors are concerned with materiality.\n\nAn mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMateriality, Error, and Fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, for a $10 billion net profit business, a $1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a $1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.\nThe threshold of materiality is often set at some percentage of net income before tax (ex. 5%) or revenue (1-2%).\nThere is also a distinction between Error and Fraud. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is intentional: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of an engagement, the auditor needs to write an opinion on the level of assurance they can assure regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. There are two levels of assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable Assurance\nLimited Assurance\n\n\n\n\nHigh level of assurance of accuracy, but not absolute.\nModerate/low level of assurance of accuracy.\n\n\nConclusion expressed positively.\nConclusion expressed negatively.\n\n\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements show a true and fair view.\n\n\nNothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial information is not true and fair.\n\n\n\nUsed in statutory audits.\nUsed in all other engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expectations Gap\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers and the public often misinterpret audit opinions to mean other things. This “expectation” of the public contrasting with what audit opinions actually claim is called the expectations gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\nReality\n\n\n\n\nThe public often thinks the auditor detects all fraud and error.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors test 100% of transactions.\nThis is not true, most audits sample transactions to test.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the accuracy of financial statements.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the company will continue to survive for the forseeable future.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides an opinion of the accuracy of financial statements. The financial statements themselves can paint a good or bad picture, the auditor only cares if it is accurate.\n\n\nThe public often thinks the balance sheet shows the true value of the company.\nThis is not true, valuation is done by separate teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Requirements\nIn the UK, all companies are required to legally undergo a statutory audit of their financial statements every year, unless they meet a set of exemption criteria. This requirement and the exemptions are set by the Companies Act 2006.\nTo qualify for an exemption, a firm must not be an insurance, banking, or listed company. In addition, they must also meet two of the following exemption critera below:\n\nFirms that are in banking, insurance, or listed on a stock market must always undergo a statutory audit, even if they meet the criteria above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemption After 6 April 2025 (2/3)\nExemption After 1 January 2016 (2/3)\n\n\n\n\nLess than 50 employees on average.\nLess than 50 employees on average.\n\n\nLess than £7.5m in total assets.\nLess than £5.1m in total assets.\n\n\nLess than £15m in turnover.\nLess than £10.2m in turnover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Assurance\nSustainability is about meeting he needs of the present, without compromising the future from meeting their own needs. Sustainability consists of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\nAbout the planet. For example, emissions and pollution.\nAbout the people. Diversity, inclusion, worker health, mental health, etc.\nAbout company practices and ethics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of growing demand from users for information regarding sustainability, assurance is needed to ensure that the reported sustainability metrics of a firm are accurate.\nCurrently, sustainability assurance and reporting is still a developing field, but several regulations already exist.\n\nIFRS ISSBCompanies Act 2006 (UK)TCFD (UK)CSRD (EU)Assurance\n\n\nIFRS sustainability and disclosure standards are issued by the International Susstainability and Standards Board (ISSB). Their 4 key objectives are:\n\nDevelop standards for a global baseline of sustainability disclosures.\nMeet the information needs of investors.\nEnable companies to provide sustainability information to global capital markets.\nTo facilitate interoperability with disclosures that are jurisdiction-specific, as well as aimed at broader stakeholder groups.\n\nThey consist of two standards:\n\nIFRS S1: General requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information.\nIFRS S2: Climate-related disclosures.\n\nNote: ISSB do not have power to enforce these standards, and they are not legally required for companies (except in Brazil).\n\n\nThe strategic report within the Capanies Act includes some mandatory sustainability reporting requirements.\n\nReporting of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, including sustainability risks.\nInformation about environmental, social, and community matters, employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters.\nInformation about gender diversity within the company.\nClimate related financial disclosures, such as management of climate-adjacent risks and opportunities.\n\nThese are required reporting for firms in the UK.\n\n\nThe TCFD (Task force on climate-related financial disclosures) is a set of recommendations issued in 2017, recommending the reporting of:\n\nGovernance\nRisk Management\nStrategy\nMetrics and Targets.\n\nIn the UK, the TCFD recommendations are mandatory for listed companies. This is not the case in all countries.\nIFRS S2 reporting standards are based on these TCFD recommendations.\n\n\nThe European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect in 2023. It requires the following:\n\nDisclosure about a company’s sustainibility related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\nDisclosures to be reported in the annual report of a company.\nRequires companies to seek assurance over their sustainability disclosures.\n\nAll companies that have securities listed on an EU stock market must follow these directives. Any EU companies that are large (more than 250 employees, 50 million euro revenue) that are not listed must also follow the directives.\n\nNon-EU companies which generate more than 150 million in the EU that also have a EU listed subsidiary must also follow the directives. But this only comes into affect in 2028.\n\n\n\nThe international standard on sustainability assurance (ISSA) 5000 general requirements for sustainability assurance engagements was released in 2024. It provides a framework for how sustainability assurance is to take place.\nThe objectives of the ISSA 5000:\n\nThe obtain reasonable assurance or limited assurance about whether the sustainability is free from material mistatement.\nTo express a conclusion on the sustainability information through a written report that conveys a audit conclusion, and describes the basis for the conclusion.\n\nThe EU CSRD also has guidelines on how to obtain limited assurance for sustainability based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and also provides a provision to move towards reasonable assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Ethics\n\nEthical Codes\nRegulatory bodies set the rules for auditors and the auditing process. There are a few main regulatory bodies in the UK:\n\nICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): sets the code of ethics for member auditors/accountants. The ICAEW code is based on the internal code of ethics established by the IESBA.\nFRC (Financial Reporting Council): oversees auditors, sets the ethical standards for audit work, and supervises corporate governance and financial reporting bodies. The FRC also has a professional oversight function.\nIESBA (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants): develops the international code of ethics for auditors/accountants, which serves as the foundation for the ICAEW ethics code.\nRSBs (Recognised Supervisory Bodies): organisations like ICAEW that supervise auditors, and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards. These bodies work together to set, monitor, and enforce ethical standards, ensuring public trust in audits/auditors.\n\nThe ethical codes that these bodies set can be divided into two types:\n\nRule-based codes: set out specific, detailed requirements, like a checklist of what is and isn’t allowed. Ex. no gifts over £30.\nPrinciple-based codes: focus on broad principles that guide behaviour for a wide range of professional situations. They focus more on professional judgment rather than spelling out rules for every possible scenario. Ex. no gifts that could impair your objectivity (no specific max value). This is used by the ICAEW and IESBA, since they are more flexible and adaptable to new situations.\n\n\n\n\nEthical Principles\nICAEW’s ethics code is mostly principle-based, but also has some specific rule-based codes for specific things. There are 5 fundamental ethical principles for ICAEW:\n\nIntegrity: honest, straight forward.\nObjectivity: not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to affect your business judgment.\nProfessional Competence and Due Care: maintain your skills and knowledge to provide a competent service, and act in accordance with professional standards.\nConfidentiality: respect confidentiality of information, do not disclose without proper authority.\nProfessional Behaviour: comply with rules and regulations, avoid conduct that would discredit the occupation.\n\nIndependence is key to objectivity. Independence of mind is the ability to make decisions free from bias or influence. Independence in appearance is avoiding situations that may make a third party doubt your impartiality, even if you are already not biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Independence\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence is not necessarily threatened if auditors use the client’s services, given the prices/services the auditors are using are also available to the public.\n\nEx. Auditors can have mortgages with a bank they are auditing, as long as those mortgages and rates are publicly available, and the mortgage was obtained prior to the engagement.\nHowever, if the bank, after learning of the auditor’s appointment, provides favourable mortgages to the auditors and only the auditors, then it is a conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Biases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring Bias\nTendency to use an initial piece of information, which subsequent information is assessed.\nSay an item was $50, but now is on sale for $30. $30 might still be an overpay, but in the context of the original price, it seems cheap.\n\n\nAutomation Bias\nTendency to blindly trust output generated from automated systems.\nBlindly trusting the output from accounting software.\n\n\nAvailability Bias\nPutting more weight on experiences that easily come to mind.\nWe tend to think of plane crash news stories far more than the millions who have safe plane journeys.\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\nDisregarding information that does not fit our existing beliefs.\nCommon in politics.\n\n\nGroupthink\nTendency for groups to reach a conclusion without critical reasoning.\nSocial media like Reddit.\n\n\nOverconfidence Bias\nOverestimating one’s own abilities.\nIf you are experienced, you might not check your work as carefully and assume it is correct.\n\n\nRepresentation Bias\nAssuming the interactions/experiences you have are representative of all people.\n\n\n\nSelective Perception\nExpectations influencing personal views.\nIf you expect something to be bad, you are more likely to look for the bad parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats to Ethics\nThere are several common threats to ethical behaviour:\n\nSelf-Interest Threat: When you have a financial or personal interest that may affect your judgment/bias. Ex. owning shares in a company you are auditing.\nSelf-Review Threat: When you are in the position of reviewing your own work, or work by your team, previously did. Ex. auditing financial statements that you yourself produced.\nAdvocacy Threat: When you promote a clients position to a point where your objectivity is compromised. Ex. representing a firm in a legal dispute, yet also auditing them.\nFamiliarity Threat: Having a long standing or close relationship with the client, making you more sympathetic to them. Ex. you are auditing a company which has your best friend as financial director.\nIntimidation Threat: When you are deterred from acting objectively by external pressures. Ex. the client threatens to replace you as auditor if you do not provide favourable audit conclusion.\nManagement Threat: When you or your firm that influences client management decisions, and your interests become aligned with the client management. Ex. you do consulting services for a client that influences their management decisions, then you audit them.\n\nThese threats can be alleviated by profession-wide safeguards, such as training standards, quality control standards, and external reviews. They can also be done by work/company safeguards, like rotation of senior staff and policies on independence. If no safeguards are sufficient to address these threats, you should withdraw from/decline the engagement.\n\n\n\nSafeguards to Ethics\n\n\n\nData Protection Regulations",

    "title": "Audit Evidence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Audit evidence is the evidence that justifies the auditor’s findings and their final audit opinion (ex. reasonable assurance).\n\n\nOverview\nAudit documentation is the written record of what the auditor has done. This includes all the actions undertaken, what evidence has been obtained, and the conclusions reached. This is often called the audit file.\nAudit documentation is important for a few reasons:\n\nProves the audit was performed according to professional standards, such as ISA (UK) 230.\nAllows other auditors to understand your work and conclusions, even if they were not involved in the audit.\nIt provides support if your work is ever challenged by regulators, clients, or in court.\n\nGood documentation is essential for quality control, learning, and legal protection.\nThere are two main types of audit procedures:\n\nTests of Control: these are designed to evaluate whether a company’s internal controls are operating effectively.\nSubstantive Procedures: these are designed to find material misstatements, such as errors in account balances, transactions, or disclosures.\n\n\n\n\nGathering Evidence\nAuditors use a range of methods to gather evidence to support their audit conclusion, each method having its benefits and drawbacks. They should be selected specifically for the audit item in question. These include:\n\nInspection: examining records, documents, or physcial assets. For example, an auditor could look at an invoice to confirm the cost of inventory. Third party documentation (like invoices, certificates) are more reliable than internally created documents. Inspection can provide evidence regarding the existence of things, the value of things, the rights and obligations (like in a contract), and the completeness of things. Inspection may not work well for intangible items like goodwill, or evaluating a process rather than outcomes.\nObservation: watching a process or procedure being performed. For example, observe a firm’s staff counting inventory. Observation is useful for confirming a process is performed as described. However, be aware that processes may not be the same when observed vs. unobserved. Observations are only “snapshots” of a specific moment, they do not provide evidence for long-term ongoing processes.\nInquiry and Confirmation: regards asking staff (inquiry) or third-parties (confirmation). This is useful for understanding processes or obtaining explanations. Confrimation from third parties (banks, customers) is a strong form of evidence. For example, confirming with the bank the cash balance of a firm. Be aware that oral responses are less reliable than written confirmation.\nRecalculation: checking the mathematical accuracy of documents and records. This is strong evidence as the auditor does it directly. For example, the auditor recalculates the depreciation to confirm they match the accounts. Recalculation is only useful for procedures involving mathematics, and cannot confirm the existence of assets.\nReperformance: similar to recalculation, but not with math. Basically, do the same thing that the firm did previously. However, be aware that some procedures cannot be replicated (like one-off judgment).\nAnalytical Procedures: analysing data (financial and non-financial) for trends, ratios, or unexpected fluctuations. This can be done during planning, providing evidence, and as a final review. One way is to compare current metrics to previous year metrics to see major discrepancies. The reliability of analytical procedures depends on the quality and source of the data. If the underlying data is not good, then analytical procedures are not useful.\nAutomated Tools and Techniques: these include running dummy transactions through the clients system to test controls, extracting data and analysing directly from accounting systems, and using software to identify patterns and anomolies.\nRemote Auditing Techniques: this is inspection, but remote. For example, observing inventory counts through a live video, sharing documents electronically, and interviews via video call. This is useful when physical access is limited.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluating Evidence\nNot all audit evidence is equally reliable. The reliability of evidence depends on the source, nature, and how it is obtained. There are a few general principles in assessing the reliability of evidence.\n\nEvidence from independent external sources is more reliable than from the firm/client.\nEvidence directly obtained by the auditor is more reliable than that obtained indirectly (such as through a third-party). For example, a bank confirmation of balance received by the auditor directly from the bank, is better than a bank confirmation received through the client, who got it from the bank.\nWritten evidence is more reliable than oral evidence.\nOriginal documents are more reliable than copies.\nConsistent evidence from many different sources is more persuasive.\n\nIf he risk of material misstatement is high, you may seek stronger and more reliable evidence. For example, for high risk balances, auditors will seek strong, independent evidence, such as external confirmations and reperformance.\nThe international standards of auditing state that evidence must be both sufficient and appropriate. Sufficient evidence means there is enough quantity of evidence to support the conclusion. Appropriateness is about quality, and if the evidence is relevant and reliable.\n\nFactors effect sufficiency include: the level of risk, materiality, the nature and size of the account, expected error rate, and effectiveness of controls. Basically, if there is a higher risk of material mistatements, you need more evidence quantity to meet sufficiency.\nFactors that effect appropriateness include: the reliability of evidence (independent sources, written, original documents, etc.). Quality matters as much as quantity.\n\nIf you find sufficient and appropriate evidence for the balance of an account, you can confirm it as reasonable assurance that it is correct. If you do not, you may need to look for more evidence or increase the sample size (see below). If you find contradictory evidence or fraud, you should refer to a manager or higher up.\n\n\n\nSampling\nIn most audits, you cannot test every transaction, as there are too many transactions. Instead, auditors sample to select a subset of transactions to test. When selecting a sample, auditors must consider:\n\nThe population size: some accounts have larger populations of transactions. larger populations may require larger samples (but not always proportional).\nAssessed risk and expected mistatement: more risk, you need higher samples.\nLevel of materiality: the lower the materiality threshold (the lower the “tolerable error threshold” is), the larger sample you need.\nOther evidence: if there is other strong evidence, a smaller sample may suffice.\nStratification: grouping similar items can make sampling more efficient.\n\nWe want samples to reflect the population. Sampling risk is the risk that your sample might not reflect the entire population, leading to incorrect conclusions. For example, if you under-sample transactions that are likely to be fraudulent, you are likely to miss errors/fraud.",

However, cash is still important as cash is needed to pay suppliers and liabilities.\nThe cash flow statement records how cash flows in and out of a business. It is divided into 3 parts:\n\nCash flow from operating activities: this includes cash flows from core business operations, such as from sales, COGS, and operating expenses.\nCash flow from investing activities: this includes cash flow from the purchase and disposal of assets.\nCash flow from financing activities: this includes cash flows from liabilities/equity (loans, shares) and dividends.\n\nThere are two ways to prepare a cash flow statement.\n\nDirect method: this is basically recording and counting all the inflows and outflows of cash.\nIndirect method (more common): it uses different details from the income statement and balance sheet to work out the cash flow. Essentially, it is undoing the accruals/prepayments and payables/receivables to calculate cash flow.\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Method\nCash flow from operating activities:\n\nStart with the profit before tax figure from the income statement.\nAdd finance costs (so if you spend £X on finance costs, do + £X).\nSubtract finance income (so if you earn £X in finance income, do -£X).\nSubtract profits from disposal of non-current assets (so if you earn £X, do -£X, and if you lost £X, do +£X).\nAdd depreciation expense (so if you spent £X on depreciation costs, do +£X).\nAdd amoritsation expense (so if you spent £X on amoritsation, do +£X).\nSubtract change in inventory (so if inventory increased from last period, subtract. If inventory decreased from last period, add).\nSubtract change in trade receivables (so if receivables increased from last period, subtract. If receivables decreased from last period, add).\nAdd change in trade payables (so if payables account increased from last period, add.

    "text": "Errors and Controls\nThere are 5 main types of errors:\n\nErrors of omission: forgetting to include a transaction in the accounts.\nTransposition errors: when an accountant accidentally swaps the positions of digits in an entry. For example, instead of £3,850, they record it as £3,580.\nErrors of principle: when an accountant records a transaction that breaks the rules/standards of accounting.\nErrors of commission: when an accountant records a transaction in the correct large account but wrong sub-account. For example, they correctly choose asset/liability/equity, but put it in the wrong account. The most common is recording one expense as another.\nCompensating errors: when two are more errors offset each other, resulting in a correct balance for all accounts, but the individual errors are still there.\n\nTo correct errors, we should take a few steps.\n\nIdentify the incorrect entry. Note the values included in this incorrect entry.\nDecide what the correct entry should be. Note the values included in this correct entry.\nCompare the result of the first two steps, and create a journal entry to fix the error. This journal entry should correct the account balances from the incorrect entry to the correct entry. We do not withdraw the old entry, just a new entry to correct the difference.\n\nSuspense accounts are a way to avoid errors in the first place. Sometimes, you know one account for the entry debits/credits, but you are not sure about another. Thus, instead of putting the unknown side of the transaction into a wrong account, you can put it into a temporary account called a suspense account. Later, you can correctly record the transaction.",

    "text": "The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.\n\n\nOverview\nThe income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit. Revenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).\n\nFrom revenue, a number of things are subtracted:\n\nThe cost of sales, or cost of goods sold (COGS) are subtracted from the revenue to obtain gross profit. COGS is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\nThen, from gross profit, we further subtract operating expenses to obtain operating profit (profit or loss from operations). Operating expenses are a wide range of costs that are neccesary to run the business, such as rent, wages, electricity bills, telephone, research and development, etc.\nThen, from operating profit, we subtract finance costs to obtain net profit before tax. finance costs are expenses that are needed for financing arrangements, such as interest from loans/overdrafts.\nFinally, from net profit before tax, we subtract tax expenses to obtain net profit.\n\nThe net profit (or loss) is then added (or subtracted) to the retained earnings account within the capital/equity section of the balance sheet. This is usually balanced by assigning the profit/loss to the cash asset account.\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, or Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\n\nFor example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the reported revenue, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes in inventory.\n\nTo calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the formula:\n\nCOGS = opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory\n\nThis accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.",

    "text": "Overview\n\n\n\nComposition of Equity\nFor companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:\n\nRetained Earnings: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.\nShare Capital: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.\n\nFor example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.\nThis capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as shares. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.\nThis initial share price (ex. £1) is called the Par Value or Nominal Value, and will never change, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an ordinary share.\n\nShare Premium: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.\n\nLets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.\nShares cannot be issued below the par value.\nLets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.\nSince the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a share premium of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.\nThe remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.\n\n\n\nStatement of Changes in Equity\nThe statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.\n\nIt lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).\nThen it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.\nThe closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.\n\n\nThus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.",

    "text": "Internal controls are the policies and procedures put in place by management of a firm to comply with regulations and produce reliable financial statements.\n\n\nOverview\nOrganisations use internal controls to detect and prevent errors, safeguard assets, and ensure accurate and complete financial reporting, promote operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with regulations.\nStrong controls lower the risk of material mistatements. Weak controls increase this risk, requiring auditors to do more testing. There are a few key aspects of internal controls.\n\nControl environment: the overall attitude, awareness, and actions of management regarding internal controls. This includes governance structures like the board and audit committee. These governance structures “set the tone” for internal controls. Good environments can include frequent meetings of the audit committee to discuss the control process.\nRisk assessment process: how the firm identifies and manages business risk.\nMonitoring of controls: ongoing or separate evaluations to ensure controls are working as intended. For example, audit comittee holding monthly examinations of the firm’s approach to risk management.\nInformation systems and communication: how information is correctly recorded, stored, and processed to ensure accurate record keeping and reporting.\nControl activities: policies that ensure management directives are carried out, such as authorisations and segregation of duties. For example, requiring multiple people to approve large payments.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples of Controls\nThe management designs, implements, and monitors the system of internal controls. A good control system has a few principles:\n\nControls must be designed to address specific risks. For example, unauthorised payments or errors in financial reporting.\nControls should be implemented and operated consistently, not just on paper.\nControls need to be monitored and updated as risks and business processes change.\n\nNo control system is foolproof: they are often designed for routine transactions and processes, so can fail when there is abnormal activity. Limitations to control systems can include:\n\nCost: many modern control systems can be costly for small firms.\nHuman error or deliberate override.\nCollusion between staff.\nControls only applying to frequent events, not one-off events.\n\nTo document and understand internal control processes, including modern controls, auditors and staff consult internal control manuals, policy documents, minutes from audit comittee meetings, interviews with staff in controls, and observation of controls in action. This information can be recorded in many ways, including checklists to ensure all controls are working, and diagrams and flowcharts to visualise how controls work.\n\n\n\nTypes of Controls\nControls can be divided into two main categories:\n\nPreventative controls: designed to stop errors or fraud, before they happen. Prevent problems from occurring. This can include requiring manager’s approval before making a payment, thus preventing erroneous payments from being made in the first place.\nDetective controls: designed to detect errors or fraud, after they have already occurred, so corrective actions can be taken. For example, reconciling the bank statement with the cash book can detect any errors or fraud in cash payments.\n\nThere are many types of controls that are often seen in firms:\n\nAuthorisation and Approvals: these include things such as requiring authorisation/approval of payments/other decisions. This ensures only valid and necessary transactions are processed.\nReconciliations: comparing two different records of the same transactions, such as bank statements and cash book. This can detect discrepancies, allowing for the identification of errors or omissions, thus allowing these errors to be fixed.\nVerifications: Similar to reconciliations. For example, checking that sales invoices match the goods dispatched. This ensures transactions are accurate and complete.\nPhysical and Logical Controls: Physical restrictions to limit the risk of errors/fraud. For example, only allowing authorised staff to access certain things, such as an inventory storage. Or restricting the hours. This safeguards assets from theft/misuse.\nSegregation of Duties: Dividing different parts of the same activity between different actors. For example, for a sale, one staff member records it in the sales record, while the other inputs it into the accounting software. By segregating these duties, this reduces the ability for one person controls all aspects of a transaction, reducing the chance of human error as well as fraud. The biggest threat to this control is a lack of staff.\nIT Controls: These are policies and procedures that support the proper operation of IT systems. Ensures that the IT system is reliable and secure. Types can include standards for design and programming, testing IT systems before releasing them, access controls requiring passwords and accounts, and procedures for installing software and training staff. While IT systems can improve efficiency and consistency, they also have risks. If an IT system is set up incorrectly, mistakes can affect a large amount of transactions. Cyber security threats also exist. Over-reliance on automated outputs results in staff unable to exercise professional scepticism.\nInformational processing controls: controls over how data is processed, whether manually or by IT system. Examples include document counts ensuring all documents are processed, digit verification checking numbers are entered correctly, and automated checks in software such as for duplicate transactions or unbalanced account.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Audit\nInternal audit is an independent function in a firm, responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls.\nInternal auditers do not implement or design controls, as that is the job of management. Instead, they provide assurance to management and the board that controls are working correctly and as intended. The responsibilities of internal audit are:\n\nTesting whether controls are operating effectively.\nReviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.\nChecking compliance with laws, regulations, and company policies.\nRecommending improvements to controls and processes for management to action on.\nAssisting in fraud detection and risk management.\n\nIn smaller firms without an internal audit function, external auditors may perform the role of providing feedback on control weaknesses. However, the responsibility of monitoring (the other functions of internal audit) will be with the firm’s management.\n\n\n\nModern Controls\nAs organisations adopt new technologies, new risks emerge. Modern internal controls address these risks, including cyber security, supply chain management, and digital transformation.\n\nCybersecurity: these risks include human error (ex. weak passwords), fraud and deliberate sabotage, computer malware, DDos attacks. To mitigate these risks, firms often require strong password policies and frequent password changes, firewalls and anti-virus software, and access controls for authorised users only.\nSupply Chain Risks: these risks include disruptions from supplier failure, nature disasters, and geopolitical events. To mitigate these risks, firms can vet and monitor suppliers, maintain alternative suppliers, reviewing supplier contracts regularly, and using tech to track supplies and shipments.\nDigital Transformation: these risks from new tech include overreliance on tech, automation bias, and trusting systems without sufficient review. Controls include regular reviewing and testing of automated processes, maintaining manual checks for critical transactions, and training staff to interpret and question system outputs.",

    "title": "Process of Assurance Engagements",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Agreeing an Engagement\nBefore an assurance engagement starts, a few things need to be done:\n\nObtaining the engagement: practitioners can advertise their services. The responsible party can tender: invite multiple practitioners to “apply” to be their practitioner for the engagement, and choosing based on price/approach/etc.\n\nPractitioners can obtain engagements through advertising/tendering. However, they must ensure these do not compromise their independence or integrity as required by ethical standards.\n\nAccepting the engagement. A few things can influence this choice of acceptance:\n\nIf there is a previous auditor, the current practitioner must communicate with them, and determine if there are any reasons not to accept (like ethical concerns). Permission must be granted by the responsible party for this communication, but if this permission is denied, the audit is almost always refused by the practitioner.\nThe practitioner needs to assess resources.\nClient due diligence: verifying the identity of the business the practitioner is accepting as a client, and ensure the business is legit and not money laundering.\n\nAgreeing to terms: this is done with an engagement letter, which is a contract between the practitioner and responsible party.\n\nThe engagement letter is required and regulated by standards such as ISA 210 for audits, or ISAE 3000 for other assurance engagements.\nThe letter covers the objective and scope of the engagement, the responsibilities of the practitioner and responsible party, the reporting framework (what accounting standards), and the form and final contact of the final report.\nThis will prevent miscommunication and disagreements later.\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Risk and Planning\nAssurance engagements, like audits, give confidence that information is accurate and free from material statement. However, no system is perfect, and errors/fraud can still be present even if undetected. Audit is thus about managing these risks of potential errors and fraud. There are 2 types of risks:\n\nBusiness risk: risk that events or conditions will prevent a firm from achieving its objectives. These can include economics, competitors, or new regulations. Business risks can affect the financial statements. For example, it may incentives management to lie about something (like profit, expenses) if there is financial or operational risk. Fast growing companies can also risk not having well developed controls to prevent errors and fraud.\n\nFinancial risk: cash flow problems or difficulties rasing finance.\nOperational risk: losing a key supplier or production failures.\nCompliance risk: failing to follow laws or regulations which leads to fines or reputations damages.\n\nAudit Risks: business risks that impact the financial statements/audit process are audit risks. Audit risk is the risk that the audit conclusion is incorrect (in other words, the auditor fails to detect material mistatements). Audit risk is from the auditor’s perspective. Generally, an auditor wants this risk to be minimal when issuing a reasonable assurance conclusion. Audit risk (AR) has parts: \\(AR=IR\\times CR \\times DR\\):\n\nIR (Inherent Risk): the risk of a material misstatement occurring in the financial statements, due to business risks (nature of business), before considering any controls/processes to prevent these risks. Basically, the risk of an erroneous or fraudulent financial statement entries without considering controls.\nCR (Control Risk): the risk that a material misstatement is not prevented or detected by the firm’s internal controls.\nDR (Detection Risk): the risk the auditor’s procedures will fail to detect any material misstatements. This is managed by the auditor, and is dependent on the nature of the audit plan, the timing of the audit and procedures, and extent of audit procedures. This cannot be reduced to 0, since the auditor cannot check every single transaction of the firm.\n\n\nIf the inherent and control risk is high, the number of transactions and extent of audit procedures can be increased to reduce the chance of detection risk (and chance of audit risk). This is usually determined in the planning stage of an audit.",
