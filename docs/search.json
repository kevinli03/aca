    "text": "This page covers the basics of assurance, ethical codes, and obtaining/accepting an assurance engagement. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Assurance\n\nElements of Assurance\nAssurance is when an independent professional (auditor) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the “quality”/state of the firm. This assurance given by the independent professional assures investors and stakeholders of the accuracy of the information, allowing them to make choices.\nThere are three parties in any assurance engagement:\n\nPractitioner: the auditor or independent professional.\nResponsible Party: the firm/company that is being audited. Typically, we focus on the directors of this firm/company.\nIntended User: typically stakeholders such as shareholders, investors, banks, or anyone needing to know details about a firm’s financial performance.\n\nAssurance can take many different forms:\n\nStatutory Audit: the auditing of financial statements, governed by accounting standards and reporting regulations.\nSustainability Assurance: the auditing of a firm’s sustainability figures and reports.\nOther assurance engagements, such as due diligence before performing transactions, internal controls assessment, fraud investigations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits and Limitations of Assurance\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nIndependent scrutiny of the business by experts, which adds credibility to the firm’s financial statements.\nCan help deter the appeal of fraud for those in the firm.\nDraws attention to issues, such as ethical issues or weaknesses of internal controls.\nReduces risk of management bias.\n\nLimitations:\n\nAssurance does not provide 100% assurance for accuracy, since you cannot possibly test and check every transaction made by a firm (especially large firms).\nCannot solve potential issues of collusion fraud between auditors and companies.\nFinancial information often includes subjective matters, such as depreciation and provision for doubtful debts.\nMay rely on some sub-optimal evidence, such as management representations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Assurance\nUsually, when considering the accuracy of financial statements, auditors are concerned with materiality.\n\nA mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMateriality, Error, and Fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, for a $10 billion net profit business, a $1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a $1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.\nThe threshold of materiality is often set at some percentage of net income before tax (ex. 5%) or revenue (1-2%).\nThere is also a distinction between Error and Fraud. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is intentional: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of an engagement, the auditor needs to write an opinion on the level of assurance they can assure regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. There are two levels of assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasonable Assurance\nLimited Assurance\n\n\n\n\nHigh level of assurance of accuracy, but not absolute.\nModerate/low level of assurance of accuracy.\n\n\nConclusion expressed positively.\nConclusion expressed negatively.\n\n\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements show a true and fair view.\n\n\nNothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial information is not true and fair.\n\n\n\nUsed in statutory audits.\nUsed in all other engagements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Expectations Gap\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers and the public often misinterpret audit opinions to mean other things. This “expectation” of the public contrasting with what audit opinions actually claim is called the expectations gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\nReality\n\n\n\n\nThe public often thinks the auditor detects all fraud and error.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors test 100% of transactions.\nThis is not true, most audits sample transactions to test.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the accuracy of financial statements.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.\n\n\nThe public often thinks auditors guarantee the company will continue to survive for the forseeable future.\nThis is not true, the auditor only provides an opinion of the accuracy of financial statements. The financial statements themselves can paint a good or bad picture, the auditor only cares if it is accurate.\n\n\nThe public often thinks the balance sheet shows the true value of the company.\nThis is not true, valuation is done by separate teams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Requirements\nIn the UK, all companies are required to legally undergo a statutory audit of their financial statements every year, unless they meet a set of exemption criteria. This requirement and the exemptions are set by the Companies Act 2006.\nTo qualify for an exemption, a firm must not be an insurance, banking, or listed company. In addition, they must also meet two of the following exemption critera below:\n\nFirms that are in banking, insurance, or listed on a stock market must always undergo a statutory audit, even if they meet the criteria above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemption After 6 April 2025 (2/3)\nExemption After 1 January 2016 (2/3)\n\n\n\n\nLess than 50 employees on average.\nLess than 50 employees on average.\n\n\nLess than £7.5m in total assets.\nLess than £5.1m in total assets.\n\n\nLess than £15m in turnover.\nLess than £10.2m in turnover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Assurance\nSustainability is about meeting he needs of the present, without compromising the future from meeting their own needs. Sustainability consists of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\nSocial\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\nAbout the planet. For example, emissions and pollution.\nAbout the people. Diversity, inclusion, worker health, mental health, etc.\nAbout company practices and ethics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of growing demand from users for information regarding sustainability, assurance is needed to ensure that the reported sustainability metrics of a firm are accurate.\nCurrently, sustainability assurance and reporting is still a developing field, but several regulations already exist.\n\nIFRS ISSBCompanies Act 2006 (UK)TCFD (UK)CSRD (EU)Assurance\n\n\nIFRS sustainability and disclosure standards are issued by the International Susstainability and Standards Board (ISSB). Their 4 key objectives are:\n\nDevelop standards for a global baseline of sustainability disclosures.\nMeet the information needs of investors.\nEnable companies to provide sustainability information to global capital markets.\nTo facilitate interoperability with disclosures that are jurisdiction-specific, as well as aimed at broader stakeholder groups.\n\nThey consist of two standards:\n\nIFRS S1: General requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information.\nIFRS S2: Climate-related disclosures.\n\nNote: ISSB do not have power to enforce these standards, and they are not legally required for companies (except in Brazil).\n\n\nThe strategic report within the Capanies Act includes some mandatory sustainability reporting requirements.\n\nReporting of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, including sustainability risks.\nInformation about environmental, social, and community matters, employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters.\nInformation about gender diversity within the company.\nClimate related financial disclosures, such as management of climate-adjacent risks and opportunities.\n\nThese are required reporting for firms in the UK.\n\n\nThe TCFD (Task force on climate-related financial disclosures) is a set of recommendations issued in 2017, recommending the reporting of:\n\nGovernance\nRisk Management\nStrategy\nMetrics and Targets.\n\nIn the UK, the TCFD recommendations are mandatory for listed companies. This is not the case in all countries.\nIFRS S2 reporting standards are based on these TCFD recommendations.\n\n\nThe European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect in 2023. It requires the following:\n\nDisclosure about a company’s sustainibility related impacts, risks, and opportunities.\nDisclosures to be reported in the annual report of a company.\nRequires companies to seek assurance over their sustainability disclosures.\n\nAll companies that have securities listed on an EU stock market must follow these directives. Any EU companies that are large (more than 250 employees, 50 million euro revenue) that are not listed must also follow the directives.\n\nNon-EU companies which generate more than 150 million in the EU that also have a EU listed subsidiary must also follow the directives. But this only comes into affect in 2028.\n\n\n\nThe international standard on sustainability assurance (ISSA) 5000 general requirements for sustainability assurance engagements was released in 2024. It provides a framework for how sustainability assurance is to take place.\nThe objectives of the ISSA 5000:\n\nThe obtain reasonable assurance or limited assurance about whether the sustainability is free from material mistatement.\nTo express a conclusion on the sustainability information through a written report that conveys a audit conclusion, and describes the basis for the conclusion.\n\nThe EU CSRD also has guidelines on how to obtain limited assurance for sustainability based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and also provides a provision to move towards reasonable assurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessional Ethics\n\nEthical Codes\nRegulatory bodies set the rules for auditors and the auditing process. There are a few main regulatory bodies in the UK:\n\nICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): sets the code of ethics for member auditors/accountants. The ICAEW code is based on the internal code of ethics established by the IESBA.\nFRC (Financial Reporting Council): oversees auditors, sets the ethical standards for audit work, and supervises corporate governance and financial reporting bodies. The FRC also has a professional oversight function.\nIESBA (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants): develops the international code of ethics for auditors/accountants, which serves as the foundation for the ICAEW ethics code.\nRSBs (Recognised Supervisory Bodies): organisations like ICAEW that supervise auditors, and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards. These bodies work together to set, monitor, and enforce ethical standards, ensuring public trust in audits/auditors.\n\nThe ethical codes that these bodies set can be divided into two types:\n\nRule-based codes: set out specific, detailed requirements, like a checklist of what is and isn’t allowed. Ex. no gifts over £30.\nPrinciple-based codes: focus on broad principles that guide behaviour for a wide range of professional situations. They focus more on professional judgment rather than spelling out rules for every possible scenario. Ex. no gifts that could impair your objectivity (no specific max value). This is used by the ICAEW and IESBA, since they are more flexible and adaptable to new situations.\n\n\n\n\nEthical Principles\nICAEW’s ethics code is mostly principle-based, but also has some specific rule-based codes for specific things. There are 5 fundamental ethical principles for ICAEW:\n\nIntegrity: honest, straight forward.\nObjectivity: not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to affect your business judgment.\nProfessional Competence and Due Care: maintain your skills and knowledge to provide a competent service, and act in accordance with professional standards.\nConfidentiality: respect confidentiality of information, do not disclose without proper authority.\nProfessional Behaviour: comply with rules and regulations, avoid conduct that would discredit the occupation.\n\nIndependence is key to objectivity. Independence of mind is the ability to make decisions free from bias or influence. Independence in appearance is avoiding situations that may make a third party doubt your impartiality, even if you are already not biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Independence\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence is not necessarily threatened if auditors use the client’s services, given the prices/services the auditors are using are also available to the public.\n\nEx. Auditors can have mortgages with a bank they are auditing, as long as those mortgages and rates are publicly available, and the mortgage was obtained prior to the engagement.\nHowever, if the bank, after learning of the auditor’s appointment, provides favourable mortgages to the auditors and only the auditors, then it is a conflict of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Biases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBias\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nAnchoring Bias\nTendency to use an initial piece of information, which subsequent information is assessed.\nSay an item was $50, but now is on sale for $30. $30 might still be an overpay, but in the context of the original price, it seems cheap.\n\n\nAutomation Bias\nTendency to blindly trust output generated from automated systems.\nBlindly trusting the output from accounting software.\n\n\nAvailability Bias\nPutting more weight on experiences that easily come to mind.\nWe tend to think of plane crash news stories far more than the millions who have safe plane journeys.\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\nDisregarding information that does not fit our existing beliefs.\nCommon in politics.\n\n\nGroupthink\nTendency for groups to reach a conclusion without critical reasoning.\nSocial media like Reddit.\n\n\nOverconfidence Bias\nOverestimating one’s own abilities.\nIf you are experienced, you might not check your work as carefully and assume it is correct.\n\n\nRepresentation Bias\nAssuming the interactions/experiences you have are representative of all people.\n\n\n\nSelective Perception\nExpectations influencing personal views.\nIf you expect something to be bad, you are more likely to look for the bad parts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreats to Ethics\nThere are several common threats to ethical behaviour:\n\nSelf-Interest Threat: When you have a financial or personal interest that may affect your judgment/bias. Ex. owning shares in a company you are auditing.\nSelf-Review Threat: When you are in the position of reviewing your own work, or work by your team, previously did. Ex. auditing financial statements that you yourself produced.\nAdvocacy Threat: When you promote a clients position to a point where your objectivity is compromised. Ex. representing a firm in a legal dispute, yet also auditing them.\nFamiliarity Threat: Having a long standing or close relationship with the client, making you more sympathetic to them. Ex. you are auditing a company which has your best friend as financial director.\nIntimidation Threat: When you are deterred from acting objectively by external pressures. Ex. the client threatens to replace you as auditor if you do not provide favourable audit conclusion.\nManagement Threat: When you or your firm that influences client management decisions, and your interests become aligned with the client management. Ex. you do consulting services for a client that influences their management decisions, then you audit them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on Self Interest\n\n\n\n\n\npercentage of revenue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Rotation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese threats can be alleviated by profession-wide safeguards, such as training standards, quality control standards, and external reviews. They can also be done by work/company safeguards, like rotation of senior staff and policies on independence. If no safeguards are sufficient to address these threats, you should withdraw from/decline the engagement.\n\n\n\nSafeguards to Ethics\n\n\n\nData Protection Regulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining an Engagement\n\nAgreeing an Engagement\nBefore an assurance engagement starts, a few things need to be done:\n\nObtaining the engagement: practitioners can advertise their services. The responsible party can tender: invite multiple practitioners to “apply” to be their practitioner for the engagement, and choosing based on price/approach/etc.\n\nPractitioners can obtain engagements through advertising/tendering. However, they must ensure these do not compromise their independence or integrity as required by ethical standards.\n\nAccepting the engagement. A few things can influence this choice of acceptance:\n\nIf there is a previous auditor, the current practitioner must communicate with them, and determine if there are any reasons not to accept (like ethical concerns). Permission must be granted by the responsible party for this communication, but if this permission is denied, the audit is almost always refused by the practitioner.\nThe practitioner needs to assess resources.\nClient due diligence: verifying the identity of the business the practitioner is accepting as a client, and ensure the business is legit and not money laundering.\n\nAgreeing to terms: this is done with an engagement letter, which is a contract between the practitioner and responsible party.\n\nThe engagement letter is required and regulated by standards such as ISA 210 for audits, or ISAE 3000 for other assurance engagements.\nThe letter covers the objective and scope of the engagement, the responsibilities of the practitioner and responsible party, the reporting framework (what accounting standards), and the form and final contact of the final report.\nThis will prevent miscommunication and disagreements later.",

However, cash is still important as cash is needed to pay suppliers and liabilities.\nThe cash flow statement records how cash flows in and out of a business. It is divided into 3 parts:\n\nCash flow from operating activities: this includes cash flows from core business operations, such as from sales, COGS, and operating expenses.\nCash flow from investing activities: this includes cash flow from the purchase and disposal of assets.\nCash flow from financing activities: this includes cash flows from liabilities/equity (loans, shares) and dividends.\n\nThere are two ways to prepare a cash flow statement.\n\nDirect method: this is basically recording and counting all the inflows and outflows of cash.\nIndirect method (more common): it uses different details from the income statement and balance sheet to work out the cash flow.

    "text": "Overview\n\n\n\nComposition of Equity\nFor companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:\n\nRetained Earnings: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.\nShare Capital: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.\n\nFor example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.\nThis capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as shares. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.\nThis initial share price (ex. £1) is called the Par Value or Nominal Value, and will never change, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an ordinary share.\n\nShare Premium: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.\n\nLets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.\nShares cannot be issued below the par value.\nLets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.\nSince the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a share premium of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.\nThe remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.\n\n\n\nStatement of Changes in Equity\nThe statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.\n\nIt lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).\nThen it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.\nThe closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.\n\n\nThus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.",

    "text": "The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.\n\n\nOverview\nThe income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit. Revenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).\n\nFrom revenue, a number of things are subtracted:\n\nThe cost of sales, or cost of goods sold (COGS) are subtracted from the revenue to obtain gross profit. COGS is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\nThen, from gross profit, we further subtract operating expenses to obtain operating profit (profit or loss from operations). Operating expenses are a wide range of costs that are neccesary to run the business, such as rent, wages, electricity bills, telephone, research and development, etc.\nThen, from operating profit, we subtract finance costs to obtain net profit before tax. finance costs are expenses that are needed for financing arrangements, such as interest from loans/overdrafts.\nFinally, from net profit before tax, we subtract tax expenses to obtain net profit.\n\nThe net profit (or loss) is then added (or subtracted) to the retained earnings account within the capital/equity section of the balance sheet. This is usually balanced by assigning the profit/loss to the cash asset account.\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, or Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\n\nFor example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the reported revenue, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes in inventory.\n\nTo calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the formula:\n\nCOGS = opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory\n\nThis accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.",

    "text": "Internal controls are the policies and procedures put in place by management of a firm to comply with regulations and produce reliable financial statements. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nInternal Controls\n\nSystems of Controls\nInternal controls are systems implemented and maintained by the management of a company (internally), to ensure financial reporting is reliable and accurately, the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, and compliance with applicable laws and regulation.\nA good control system has a few principles:\n\nControls must be designed to address specific risks. For example, unauthorised payments or errors in financial reporting.\nControls should be implemented and operated consistently, not just on paper.\nControls need to be monitored and updated as risks and business processes change.\n\nExamples of controls include:\n\nQuality control can prevent the production of poor quality goods.\nCredit control can limit the level of bad debts\nControls over inventory can prevent running out of inventory and ensure optimal levels of inventory.\nCompliance department can ensure business adheres to relevant laws and regulations.\nControls over payroll ensure salaries are paid correctly, avoiding disputes with staff, and avoiding mistakes over payroll taxes.\n\nAuditors care about the internal controls, as it impacts the audit risk, and how we plan for an audit. Thus, auditors often take notes, confirm checklists, and diagram/flowchart internal controls. Walkthrough tests of controls are done to obtain information about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman error or intentional collusion which can bypass systems.\nAbnormal/occasional transactions which may not fit into the control system.\nManagement override.\nInformal nature/lack of documentation, especially in smaller companies.\nLimited number of staff which limits segregation of duties.\nThe costs of controls may exceed the potential risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of Controls\nA company’s control activities are the policies/procedures that help ensure that management directives are carried out. They can be:\n\nPreventative controls: preventing errors from occurring in the first place.\nDetective controls: detecting errors/fraud that have already occurred.\n\nAside for control activities, there are also other aspects of a system of controls:\n\nActivitiesEnvironmentRisk ProcessInformation SystemMonitoring\n\n\nThere are 5 types of different control activities (and an additional one), according to ISA (UK) 315:\n\nAuthorisation and approval (preventative). Example: expenses require authorisation and approval (can be automated)\nReconcilliations (detective): compare two or more data elements (ex. balances), and match the balance (nothing without matching/agreeing the balance is a reconciliation).\nVerifications (detective): verify something with another source of evidence (verify completeness/occurrence, not matching balances like reconciliation).\nPhysical/Logical controls (preventative/detective): physical security (like locks, passwords), checks for the number of documents/invoices (logical true/false).\nSegregation of duties (preventative): assigning different people different parts of the same task, thus requiring multiple people to check/complete and preventing one person from committing fraud alone.\nGeneral IT Checks which check machines work properly (antivirus, testing system processes), while information processing controls are IT versions of verification, reconciliation, and logical controls when dealing with info input.\n\n\n\nThe control environment is the overall attitude, awareness, and actions of management regarding internal controls. This “sets the tone” for internal controls. Good environments can include:\n\nExistence and frequent meeting of an audit committee, and an internal audit function.\nEffective documentation of control systems, importance of controls communicated to all staff, and recruiting only employees integrity.\nNo management override of controls.\n\nAn audit committee (mandatory for listed companies) is a subsection of the board of directors. It has the following characteristics:\n\nAll members must be non-executive directors. The internal audit chief should not sit on the committee, as they are an executive director.\nRequired to have written terms of reference, which includes committee objectives and the format and content of reports to the board of directors.\nOverseas the financial statement, internal audit, and external audit appointments.\n\n\n\nA company’s risk assessment process is a process for identifying and anlaysing business risks.Business risks is a risk that could adversely effect a company’s ability to achieve its objectives and execute its strategies.\n\nBusiness risks can often impact inherent risk, a part of the Audit risk equation.\n\nA risk assessment process should have the following steps:\n\nIdentify relevant business risks, such as changes i noperating environment, new systems, rapid growth (international), new technology.\nEstimate the significance of the risks. Is it high, medium, or low?\nAssess the likelihood of the risk occuring.\nDecide on actions to address the risk.\n\n\n\nA company’s information system and communication shows how information is correctly recorded, stored, and processed to ensure accurate record keeping and reporting.\nThis includes the financial reporting system, and how transactions are recorded and processed. Auditors are interested in things such as:\n\nClasses of transactions (like types/categories they are saved in).\nSystems used to prepare financial systems, such as accounting software.\nAccounting records and information, such as invoices and receipts.\nRoles and responsibilities allocated to staff - who can change things, who can input things, who can view things, and if there are dangers of controls being overridden.\n\n\n\nOngoing or separate evaluations to ensure controls activities are working as intended.\n\nDirectors should assess if they are still adequate, especially when there are changes in the environment and business risks.\nControls should be monitored at all levels.\nInternal audit can test controls, and recommend changes.\nExternal audit can highlight deficiencies during the auditing process, that the directors can take and implement fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmerging Technologies\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand controls, an auditor must understand the technology the organisation is using in its processes, and the associated risks.\n\nRobotic Process Autmoation (RPA) are automated processes that automate tasks based on “if this, then that” instructions. They are common for repetitive tasks. It is important to test if these systems are operating correctly.\nGenerative AI is also being used very commonly. However, we have to be concerned about the biases in AI, data privacy in training data, transparency behind AI decisions, and environmental impacts of AI. There should be controls and procedures to minimise these risks.\nCloud computing and storage, such as online storage or accounting records, are also vulnerable to risks such as data privacy and security, as well as data corruption. There should be controls over these risks, such as password changes and backup policies.\nDigital signatures are also commonly used, but can be forged. Effective control systems will have logs and certificate of completion as controls.\nCybersecurity risks, such as attacks, are also a vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenue System\n\n\n\n\n\nPurchases System\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Costs\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Audit\n\n\n\n\n\nInternal Audit\nInternal audit is an independent function in a firm, responsible for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of internal controls.\nInternal auditers do not implement or design controls, as that is the job of management. Instead, they provide assurance to management and the board that controls are working correctly and as intended. The responsibilities of internal audit are:\n\nTesting whether controls are operating effectively.\nReviewing the efficiency and effectiveness of operations.\nChecking compliance with laws, regulations, and company policies.\nRecommending improvements to controls and processes for management to action on.\nAssisting in fraud detection and risk management.\n\nIn smaller firms without an internal audit function, external auditors may perform the role of providing feedback on control weaknesses. However, the responsibility of monitoring (the other functions of internal audit) will be with the firm’s management.\n\n\n\nModern Controls\nAs organisations adopt new technologies, new risks emerge. Modern internal controls address these risks, including cyber security, supply chain management, and digital transformation.\n\nCybersecurity: these risks include human error (ex. weak passwords), fraud and deliberate sabotage, computer malware, DDos attacks. To mitigate these risks, firms often require strong password policies and frequent password changes, firewalls and anti-virus software, and access controls for authorised users only.\nSupply Chain Risks: these risks include disruptions from supplier failure, nature disasters, and geopolitical events. To mitigate these risks, firms can vet and monitor suppliers, maintain alternative suppliers, reviewing supplier contracts regularly, and using tech to track supplies and shipments.\nDigital Transformation: these risks from new tech include overreliance on tech, automation bias, and trusting systems without sufficient review. Controls include regular reviewing and testing of automated processes, maintaining manual checks for critical transactions, and training staff to interpret and question system outputs.",

    "text": "This page covers the general process of assurance and audit engagements, starting from planning, to concluding. The content in this section is a part of the Assurance and Risk Fundamentals (certificate level) for the ACA qualification.\n\n\n\nAudit Planning\n\nPlanning Process\nBefore starting an accepted engagement, there needs to be a plan. This helps preparing the neccesary resources (funding, team size, timeline) of the audit, as well as what areas are potentially higher risk for fraud/error.\nThere are two documents that are needed to plan an audit engagement.\n\nAudit strategy: Determines the scope, timing, and direction of the audit, and shapes the audit plan.\nAudit plan: More detailed, shows how the overall strategy will be implemented.\n\n\nAudit StrategyAudit Plan\n\n\nThe key components of the audit strategy are:\n\nUnderstanding the client, and its environment.\nMaterality threshold. What is considered material?\nRisk assessment. What are the risky areas for potential material misstatement?\nNature, extent, and timing of audit procedures.\nDirection of the audit, who is supervising, and generally how review of the audit work will be undertaken.\n\n\n\nThe audit plan ensures the following:\n\nAttention (in-depth planning) is paid to the most important areas (high risk areas).\nPotential problems/risks are identified early.\nThe audit is properly organised and managed.\nWork is assigned to the appropriate member of the audit team, and team members receive direction and supervision of team members.\nReviews by more senior auditors are planned and facilitated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Client\nISA (UK) 315 requires auditors to gain an understanding of the client. This is because it is necessary to understand what areas have higher risk of fraud/error, in order to design an effective audit strategy and plan.\nSpecifically, auditors should understand:\n\nThe industry and regulatory environment of the client, which can help identify risks.\nNature of the client, including the client’s selection and application of accounting policies.\nObjectives and strategy of the client, and related business risks, which may affect the risk of material misstatement.\nMeasurement and review of the client’s financial performance. This could indicate pressure on directors to commit fraud.\nThe strength and effectiveness of internal controls at preventing errors/fraud. If these are weak, the risk of material misstatement is higher.\n\nAuditors also need to understand the client’s financial reporting framework, and its accounting policies.\n\nFinancial Reporting FrameworkAccounting Policies\n\n\n\nWhat are the accounting principles and industry-specific accounting principles.\nReporting of revenue recognition.\nAccounting for financial instruments.\nReporting of foreign currency assets, liabilities, and transactions.\nAccounting principles for unusual or complex transactions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the methods used to recognise, measure, and disclose significant and unusual transactions? For example, foreign transactions.\nHow do they use accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas, where there is a lack of regulation, guidance, or consensus?\nHow do they deal with changes in the environment that may require a change in accounting policies.\nWhat financial reporting standards, laws, and regulations that are new to the client.\n\n\n\n\nTo get this information, auditors can ask the client’s management, conduct analytical procedures, observe processes, and inspect documents and assets.\n\n\n\nAudit Risk\nAuditors do not want to give a wrong opinion, since shareholders/users depend on the auditor’s opinion. Thus, auditors want to lower the audit risk of an incorrect opinion, such as failing to detect fraud/errors.\nThe risk of an audit (audit risk) is calculated as follows:\n\nAudit Risk \\(=\\) Inherent Risk \\(\\times\\) Control Risk \\(\\times\\) Detection Risk\n\n\nInherent RiskControl RiskDetection Risk\n\n\n\nThe client’s risk of error/fraud, which cannot be controlled by auditors. This is usually related to the business/industry/regulatory environment.\nFor example, if the management is under pressure, there is an inherent risk of fraud due to this pressure.\nIf certain items/transactions are new, complex, one-off, or subjective, they are high risk.\n\nPg. 48 see more\n\n\n\nHow strong a client’s internal controls are to detect the inherent risk of error/fraud.\nStronger controls mean less control risk. Weaker controls means higher control risk. This makes sense - weaker controls are more likely to fail to detect errors/fraud.\nAuditors generally cannot control this as well.\n\nSee the internal controls page for more details on how controls work, and how to evaluate controls.\n\n\nThe risk that auditors fail to detect material misstatements. If inherent risk and control risk are higher, auditors need to reduce detection risk to lower audit risk overall.\nTo lower detection risk, auditors can:\n\nIncrease the sample size that they are testing, especially for accounts with high inherent/control risk.\nLower the materiality threshold.\nImprove the quality of evidence to make sure it is sufficient and appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Risk\n\n\n\n\n\nRisks also exist in relation to climate change. These include:\n\nPhysical Risks: risks from the physical effects of climate change, like extreme weather and storms. For example, dependent on supply chains/stock affected by climate change, such as farming and storms.\nTransitional Risks: Risks relating to shifts to a low-carbon economy, such as changes to policy, regulation, technology, and market.\n\nThese are important because they can affect the financial statements. For example, destroyed assets/inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Parties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA related party is a firm who is influenced, or has influence over the client. For example, company A’s director is married to company B’s (our client’s) company.\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with transactions involving a related party. However, they do increase the potential of manipulation between the two parties.\nGenerally, there is the principle of arm’s length: that if the two parties were not related, the transaction’s prices would still make sense.\nRelated party transactions must be disclosed separately, even if arm’s length is met. These are considered material by nature (regardless of the size of the transaction).\nRelated parties can be difficult to identify, and if there is manipulation, these are often concealed from auditors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Materiality\nRecall that a mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\nWhen determining if a transaction/error is material, there are two ways to do this:\n\nMaterial based on the size of the transaction (common thresholds below). This is determined during the planning stage.\nMaterial based on the nature. For example, transactions between the company and its directors must be disclosed, as these are considered material regardless of size. Related party transactions are also material by nature.\n\nIn higher risk businesses, the tolerance level for mistakes is lower, so we set the materiality threshold to the lower end of these ranges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nThreshold Size\n\n\n\n\nProfit before tax\n5% to 10%\n\n\nRevenue\n0.5% to 1%\n\n\nTotal Assets\n1% to 2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance Materiality\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance materiality is an amount set by the auditor lower than the materiality threshold of the financial statements to reduce the risk of a specific account.\n\nFor example, if one branch of a large company is accused of fraud, you might have a special performance materiality for that branch, while the other branches are at the normal threshold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainability Materiality\n\n\n\n\n\nIn sustainability assurance, materiality is assessed in a similar way.\n\nISSB sustainability materiality: sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably affect the entity’s prospects that could influence the decisions of users.\nDouble materiality is a concept which considers not only the sustainability issues that reate financial risks for a company, but also the materiality of a company’s impact on people and the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytical Procedures\nAnalytical procedures is comparing non-financial information (like expectations based on experience) to actual financial information. Inconsistencies in comparisons may indicate potential risk.\n\nEx. During the pandemic lockdowns, we might assume an airline would have a difficult year, and expect a net loss. If the airline actually has a net profit, that is an inconsistency that could be a result of errors/fraud.\n\nAnalytical procedures are mandatory at planning to identify potential risks, according to ISA (UK) 315. They are also required to be used to assist forming an overall conclusion based on ISA (UK) 520.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of Analytical Procedures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey generally require strong background knowledge and experience of the client, which may be limited if the client is new.\nThey generally require experienced staff to be effective.\nThe quality of the procedure depends on the reliability of the sources.\n\n\n\n\nOften, when comparing in analytical procedures, we will need to use ratios to see how their value or how they have changed, which can be used in the comparison with our expectations.\n\nPerformanceLiquidity/SolvencyEfficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nGross Profit Margin\ngross profit \\(\\div\\) revenue\nAssesses profitability before taking operating expenses into account.\n\n\nOperating/Net Margin\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) revenue\nAssess profitability with operating expenses included.\n\n\nCost of Sales Percent\ncost of sales \\(\\div\\) revenue\nHow much costs of inventory make up of revenue.\n\n\nOperating Cost Percent\noperating expenses \\(\\div\\) revenue\nHow much operating expenses make up of revenue.\n\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE)\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) (equity + net debt)\nEffective use of resources.\n\n\nReturn on Shareholder’s Fund\noperating profit \\(\\div\\) (share capital + share reserve)\nEffective use of resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Ratio\ncurrent assets \\(\\div\\) current liabilities\nAbility to pay liabilities due soon with liquid assets.\n\n\nQuick Ratio\n(receivables + cash + current investments) \\(\\div\\) current liabilities\nAbility to pay liabilities due soon with liquid assets.\n\n\nGearing Ratio\n\n\n\n\nInterest Cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio\nCalculation\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nNet Asset Turnover\n\n\n\n\nTrade Receivables Period\n\n\n\n\nTrade Payables Period\n\n\n\n\nInventory Holding Period\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Evidence\n\nStandard of Evidence\nISA (UK) 500 requires auditors to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to draw an audit opinion.\n\nSufficient evidence is about quantity. If you have higher risk, you will need more quantity of evidence. If you have lower materiality threshold, the more quantity of evidence is needed. Reasonable assurance will need more quantity of evidence than limited assurance.\nAppropriate evidence is about the quality of evidence. Is the evidence reliable and from third parties? Is the evidence relevant to the financial statement assertions?\n\nThe highest quality form of evidence is either auditor generated or from an independent third party. Original documents are better than copies. Written evidence is better than oral evidence.\nAudit evidence is relevant depending on what we are considering:\n\nTransactions/EventsAccount Balances\n\n\nFor transactions/events, relevant evidence includes:\n\nOccurence: proof that the transaction occurred. For example, actually having the product, or an invoice.\nCompleteness: all transactions that should have been recorded are recorded.\nAccuracy: the amounts of each transaction are accurately recorded. Invoices are useful for this.\nCut-off: transactions are recorded in the correct accounting period.\nClassification: transactions are recorded in the correct accounts.\nPresentation: transactions and events are accurately aggregated, clearly described, and disclosures are relevant and understandable.\n\n\n\nFor account balances, relevant evidence includes:\n\nExistence: assets, liabilities, and equity balances do exist. Physical visits to check assets are common.\nRights and Obligations: the client actually owns the assets, and the liabilities are indeed the obligations of the client. For example, look at purchase records, contact bank for cash account/loans.\nCompletness: all assets, liabilities, and equity are recorded.\nAccuracy, Valuation, and Allocation: assets, liabilities, and equity are at the appropriate amounts.\nClassification: assets, liabilities, and equity have been recorded in the correct accounts.\nPresentation: assets, liabilities, and equity are accurately aggregated, clearly described, and disclosures are relevant and understandable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence Stage\nWalkthrough tests begin at the start of the evidence stage. The tests and procedures you will do in the audit will depend on what happens in the walkthrough test.\n\nWalkthrough test will get you a feel of the company.\nIt will help you decide if you expect the controls to be effective, or expect the controls to be ineffective.\n\nThen, your audit evidence stage will depend on which expectation you have.\n\nEffective ControlsIneffective Controls\n\n\nIf you expect effective controls after the walkthrough, the steps you will take will be:\n\nDo strong tests of controls. Note if the tests match your expectation.\nIf controls are found to be effective, you can do limited audit testing due to limitations of any control system.\nIf controls are found to be ineffective, you should conduct full substantive testing.\n\n\n\nIf you do not expect controls to be effective, the steps you will take are:\n\nSkip tests of controls, since we assume they will be ineffective.\nConduct full substantive testing.\n\n\n\n\nYou can do this for each separate account/transaction. For example, if most controls are expected to be strong, but there are certain unusual/complex/one-off transactions, you can apply the ineffective controls assumption to those.\n\n\n\nSubstantive Procedures\nSubstantive procedures are tests with numbers. ISA (UK) 500 sets out the following types of procedures:\n\nInspection: examining records, documents, or physcial assets. For example, an auditor could look at an invoice to confirm the cost of inventory. Third party documentation (like invoices, certificates) are more reliable than internally created documents. Inspection can provide evidence regarding the existence of things, the value of things, the rights and obligations (like in a contract), and the completeness of things. Inspection may not work well for intangible items like goodwill.\nObservation: watching a process or procedure being performed. For example, observe a firm’s staff counting inventory. Observation is useful for confirming a process is performed as described. However, be aware that processes may not be the same when observed vs. unobserved.\nInquiry and Confirmation: regards asking staff (inquiry) or third-parties (confirmation). This is useful for understanding processes or obtaining explanations. Confrimation from third parties (banks, customers) is a strong form of evidence. Be aware that oral responses are less reliable than written confirmation.\nRecalculation and Reperformance: checking the mathematical accuracy of documents and records. This is strong evidence as the auditor does it directly. For example, the auditor recalculates the depreciation to confirm they match the accounts. Reperformance is similar to recalculation, but not with math. Basically, do the same thing that the firm did previously.\nAnalytical Procedures: like done in the planning stage. In the evidence stage, if inconsistency of expectations and figures are unacceptable, seek further evidence.\nRemote Auditing Techniques: this is inspection, but remote. For example, observing inventory counts through a live video, sharing documents electronically, and interviews via video call. This is useful when physical access is limited.\n\nSome accounts require estimation, such as depreciation, allowance for receivables, and provisions. Since these are subjective, they are at risk of management bias. To audit these estimates, the common accounting procedures are:\n\nReview and test the process used by management to develop the estimate. Is it reasonable?\nUse an independent expert to make an estimate for comparision with the company’s figure.\nReview subsequent events (events after the year-end) for confirmation of the accuracy.\nTest the operating effectiveness of the controls over how management made the estimates.\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Tools\nModern accounting systems use computer software, so using technology to carry out audit procedures is common. There are two ways to use automate tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Data\nAudit Software\n\n\n\n\nCan be used as a test of control.\nUsed for reperformance and recalculation in substantive procedures.\n\n\nAuditor’s data (real or fake) is put into the client’s system. This tests the controls in the system.\nUsing client data (real) into the auditor’s system, to recalculate and reperform transactions. It can also be used to conduct data analysis.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nEnter data with a timesheet with hours outside the normal range to check if the system rejects it.\nEnter a valid purchase invoice to check the system correct allocates the purchase to the correct account.\n\nExamples:\n\nReperformance to check the values in accounts.\nTransaction analysis: matching purchase orders, goods received notes, and invoices.\nAnalytical procedures: analysing revenue trends by product or region.\nJudgemental areas: using sensitivity analysis to test assumptions on the net realisable value of inventory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectional Testing\nA mistated balance can be overstated (too large) or understated (too low). Generally, the risk is one direction. For example, companies rarely want to understate revenue or overtate expenses.\nTesting for overstated and understated balances is different. For example, if you are testing non-current assests, you have the following sources/accounts/records:\n\nFinancial statements (non-current assets section).\nNon-current asset register (an excel sheet of all non-current assets).\nPhysical assets (the actual non-current assets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Overstatement\nTest Understatement\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with financial statements.\nCheck the non-current asset register. See if it agrees with the financial statement.\nSelect a sample of assets in the non-current asset register.\nPerform physical checks of the sampled assets and confirm they all exist.\n\n\nStart with the physical assets you can see being used in the client’s business.\nSee if these physical assets exist in the non-current asset register.\nIf they are present, check they are also in the financial statements.\n\n\n\nWhy? If assets are overstated, that means some on the financial statements don’t exist in real life. So you start from the financial statements and check they exist.\nWhy? If assets are understated, some assets that are being used aren’t on the financial statements. Thus, start from the physical assets, and check all of them are on the financial statements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Sampling\nIn audit, we almost never check every transaction. We use a subset sample of the transactions to determine if there are material misstatements.\n\nThere are some transactions, such as high-value transactions, which will always be tested. These are not sampled.\n\nThe sampling procedure is as follows:\n\nIdentify the population. If we are auditing receivables, then receivables is our population.\nIdentify sampling unit. If we are auditing receivables, then invoices of credit customer purchases are the unit.\nSelect sample (see below).\nIdentify errors within the sample, and draw conclusions.\n\nThe way we select samples can be of many different ways.\n\nRandom selection: we randomly sample from the population.\nSystematic selection: we randomly select the first unit for the sample, then maintain the same interval between selections. Ex. invoice 5, 10, 15, etc.\nMoney sampling unit: every £1 in the population has an equal chance of being selected. So the unit is actually every £1, not each invoice.\nHaphazard sampling: just taking a sample manually without statistical theory.\n\nHaving a larger sample means lower detection risk, thus lowering the audit risk and creating a higher level of assurance.\nSampling risk is the risk that your sample might not reflect the entire population, leading to incorrect conclusions. For example, if you under-sample transactions that are likely to be fraudulent, you are likely to miss errors/fraud.\n\n\n\nErrors and Mistatements\nOnce an auditor has tested a sample of items, they must draw conclusions both to the sample, but also the entire account population.\nThings to consider include:\n\nThe nature of the errors identified. Are they true misstatements?\nThe cause of the errors identified. Do they all have a pattern - i.e. all of them have messed up VAT? Do they all occur on one day?\nThe impact on other parts of the audit. Does it affect the account balances, or do the errors cancel out? How does it affect the accounting equation.\nThe probable misstatement in the population. Determine how frequently based on the sample, the misstatement will be repeated in the unsampled population. If the total misstatement is material, then additional testing needs to be done.\n\nThe auditor must communicate all misstatements to management, and request they to be corrected, no matter if they are material or immaterial.\n\nIf a client refuses to correct a material error, first understand why management refuses. Double check it is a misstatement. If it is material, you will modify the opinion (implied opinion, see below).\nIf a misstatement is not material, and the management refuses to correct it, you do not need to modify the opinion (but it should be mentioned separately).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMisstatements Material in Nature\n\n\n\n\n\nSome categories which are always material, no matter the size, include:\n\nAffect compliance with laws and regulations.\nAffect compliance with debt covenants.\nAffect ratios used to evaluate financial position, results, or cash flows.\nIncrease the management’s compensation (renumeration).\nRelated party transactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion and Reporting\n\nAudit Opinions\nThe auditor’s report contains two different options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Opinions\nImplied (Modified) Opinions\n\n\n\n\nAlways reported in a final opinion.\nOnly required if a material problem arises.\n\n\nPresents the opinion on the financial statements:\n\nAre they true and fair?\nAre they properly prepared in accordance to accounting standards?\nIs the Information contained in the director’s report and strategic is consistent with the financial statement?\n\nReported under the following situations:\n\nReturns adequate for audit have not been received by branches not visited by the auditors.\nAccounts are not in agreement with the underlying accounting records.\nProper accounting records have not been kept.\nInformation and explanations required for the audit were not received.\nDirectors remuneration disclosures required by law were not made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudit Report Format\nISA (UK) 700 states the following must be included in the final audit report:\n\nTitle, addressee, and date of report.\nAuditor’s opinion on the financial statements, and basis for opinion.\nKey audit matters (listed companies), such as high risk, significant judgmental items, and significant transactional events.\nManagement and auditor responsibilities.\nExplanation of the extent to which the audit was capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud.\nGoing concern section, and opinion on other matters (see above).\nAdditional explanations/definitions of an assessment of risks of material misstatement, application of materiality, and overview of the scope of the audit. This is to close the expectations gap.\nName and signature of the engagement partner, and their address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Assurance Reports\n\n\n\n\n\nFor non-audit assurance engagements, a few things need to be included:\n\nIdentification and description of the subject matter (is it sustainability, due dilligence?)\nIdentification of criteria.\nAny inherent limitations which exist.\nAny restrictions upon the purpose/user.\nWork performed in accordance to which set of standards.\nConclusion must be negatively expressed (limited assurance).",
