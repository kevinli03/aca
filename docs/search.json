    "text": "Overview\n\n\n\nComposition of Equity\nFor companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:\n\nRetained Earnings: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.\nShare Capital: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.\n\nFor example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.\nThis capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as shares. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.\nThis initial share price (ex. £1) is called the Par Value or Nominal Value, and will never change, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an ordinary share.\n\nShare Premium: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.\n\nLets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.\nShares cannot be issued below the par value.\nLets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.\nSince the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a share premium of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.\nThe remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.\n\n\nThe statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.\n\n\n\nStatement of Changes in Equity\nThe statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.\n\nIt lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).\nThen it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.\nThe closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.\n\n\nThus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.",

    "text": "The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.\n\n\nOverview\nThe income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit. Revenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).\n\nFrom revenue, a number of things are subtracted:\n\nThe cost of sales, or cost of goods sold (COGS) are subtracted from the revenue to obtain gross profit. COGS is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\nThen, from gross profit, we further subtract operating expenses to obtain operating profit (profit or loss from operations). Operating expenses are a wide range of costs that are neccesary to run the business, such as rent, wages, electricity bills, telephone, research and development, etc.\nThen, from operating profit, we subtract finance costs to obtain net profit before tax. finance costs are expenses that are needed for financing arrangements, such as interest from loans/overdrafts.\nFinally, from net profit before tax, we subtract tax expenses to obtain net profit.\n\nThe net profit (or loss) is then added (or subtracted) to the retained earnings account within the capital/equity section of the balance sheet. This is usually balanced by assigning the profit/loss to the cash asset account.\n\n\n\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, or Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.\n\nFor example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the reported revenue, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes in inventory.\n\nTo calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the formula:\n\nCOGS = opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory\n\nThis accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.",

    "text": "Errors and Controls\nThere are 5 main types of errors:\n\nErrors of omission: forgetting to include a transaction in the accounts.\nTransposition errors: when an accountant accidentally swaps the positions of digits in an entry. For example, instead of £3,850, they record it as £3,580.\nErrors of principle: when an accountant records a transaction that breaks the rules/standards of accounting.\nErrors of commission: when an accountant records a transaction in the correct large account but wrong sub-account. For example, they correctly choose asset/liability/equity, but put it in the wrong account. The most common is recording one expense as another.\nCompensating errors: when two are more errors offset each other, resulting in a correct balance for all accounts, but the individual errors are still there.\n\nTo correct errors, we should take a few steps.\n\nIdentify the incorrect entry. Note the values included in this incorrect entry.\nDecide what the correct entry should be. Note the values included in this correct entry.\nCompare the result of the first two steps, and create a journal entry to fix the error. This journal entry should correct the account balances from the incorrect entry to the correct entry. We do not withdraw the old entry, just a new entry to correct the difference.\n\nSuspense accounts are a way to avoid errors in the first place. Sometimes, you know one account for the entry debits/credits, but you are not sure about another. Thus, instead of putting the unknown side of the transaction into a wrong account, you can put it into a temporary account called a suspense account. Later, you can correctly record the transaction.",

    "text": "Overview\nSince the income statement (and net profit/loss) is recorded with accrual accounting, it does not record when cash is received/leaving a business. However, cash is still important as cash is needed to pay suppliers and liabilities.\nThe cash flow statement records how cash flows in and out of a business. It is divided into 3 parts:\n\nCash flow from operating activities: this includes cash flows from core business operations, such as from sales, COGS, and operating expenses.\nCash flow from investing activities: this includes cash flow from the purchase and disposal of assets.\nCash flow from financing activities: this includes cash flows from liabilities/equity (loans, shares) and dividends.\n\nThere are two ways to prepare a cash flow statement.\n\nDirect method: this is basically recording and counting all the inflows and outflows of cash.\nIndirect method (more common): it uses different details from the income statement and balance sheet to work out the cash flow. Essentially, it is undoing the accruals/prepayments and payables/receivables to calculate cash flow.\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Method\nCash flow from operating activities:\n\nStart with the profit before tax figure from the income statement.\nAdd finance costs (so if you spend £X on finance costs, do + £X).\nSubtract finance income (so if you earn £X in finance income, do -£X).\nSubtract profits from disposal of non-current assets (so if you earn £X, do -£X, and if you lost £X, do +£X).\nAdd depreciation expense (so if you spent £X on depreciation costs, do +£X).\nAdd amoritsation expense (so if you spent £X on amoritsation, do +£X).\nSubtract change in inventory (so if inventory increased from last period, subtract. If inventory decreased from last period, add).\nSubtract change in trade receivables (so if receivables increased from last period, subtract. If receivables decreased from last period, add).\nAdd change in trade payables (so if payables account increased from last period, add. If payables account decreased, subtract).\nAdd change in accruals (so if accruals account increased from last period, add. If accruals account decreased, subtract).\nSubtract tax expense (so if you spent £X on tax, do -£X).\nSubtract interest paid (so if you spent £X on tax, do -£X).\n\nCash flow from investing activities\n\nSubtract amount spent on property, plant, and equipment (so if you spent £X, do -£X).\nSubtract amount spent on intangible assets (so if you spent £X, do -£X).\nAdd proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment (so if you gained £X, do +£X).\n\nCash flow from financing activities\n\nAdd proceeds from issue of shares (so if you gained £X, do +£X).\nAdd change in borrowings.\nSubtract dividends paid (so if you paid £X, do -£X).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "This section contains many pages on assurance and risk. Use the left-side navigation bar to navigate to different pages with more information. Below, a brief introduction to assurance is provided.\n\n\nPurpose of Assurance\nIn business, assurance is when an independent professional (accountant) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the “quality”/state of the firm.\nAssurance provides an independent professional opinion, increases confidence of users of information, can deter fraud, and highlight any problems or weaknesses in the information. Any assurance engagement consists of 3 parties:\n\nThe responsible party: the management that prepares the original information\nThe practitioner: usually an auditor/accountant who checks the information\nThe users: people who rely on the information to make decisions/choices.\n\nAt the end of a assurance engagement, a final written report is produced. The report is addressed to the responsible party, and contains the the scope of work performed, the criteria used (such as accounting standards), and the assurance provider’s opinion and conclusion, such as reasonable assurance or limited assurance.\n\nReasonable Assurance: the practitioner gathers enough opinion to give a positive opinion supporting the information the responsible party has compiled. “In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view”.\nLimited Assurance: the practitioner gathers less evidence. “Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the information is materially misstated”. Better than no assurance, but not at the level of reasonable assurance.\n\nAssurance cannot be absolute: the practitioner cannot test every element/transaction, there may be judgment involved, and there may be limitations in the information available. There is always a small chance that fraud or errors remain undiscovered.\nProfessional skepticism is key in assurance. Question information, do not accept it at face value. Investigate further before reaching a conclusion. Practisioners must apply professional judgment to decide what level of evidence is sufficient to support the level of assurance.\nThere is also a distinction between Error and Fraud. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is intentional: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.\n\n\n\nStarting an Engagement\nBefore an assurance engagement starts, a few things need to be done:\n\nObtaining the engagement: practitioners can advertise their services. The responsible party can tender: invite multiple practitioners to “apply” to be their practitioner for the engagement, and choosing based on price/approach/etc.\n\nPractitioners can obtain engagements through advertising/tendering. However, they must ensure these do not compromise their independence or integrity as required by ethical standards.\n\nAccepting the engagement. A few things can influence this choice of acceptance:\n\nIf there is a previous auditor, the current practitioner must communicate with them, and determine if there are any reasons not to accept (like ethical concerns). Permission must be granted by the responsible party for this communication, but if this permission is denied, the audit is almost always refused by the practitioner.\nThe practitioner needs to assess resources.\nClient due diligence: verifying the identity of the business the practitioner is accepting as a client, and ensure the business is legit and not money laundering.\n\nAgreeing to terms: this is done with an engagement letter, which is a contract between the practitioner and responsible party.\n\nThe engagement letter is required and regulated by standards such as ISA 210 for audits, or ISAE 3000 for other assurance engagements.\nThe letter covers the objective and scope of the engagement, the responsibilities of the practitioner and responsible party, the reporting framework (what accounting standards), and the form and final contact of the final report.\nThis will prevent miscommunication and disagreements later.\n\n\nOnce these terms are agreed, the practitioner needs to plan for the audit. This includes several steps:\n\nUnderstand the responsible party’s business and environment. Learn about the industry, operations, and regulatory landscape.\nIdentify risks. Identify areas that may require extra attention, such as complex transactions or regulations.\nResource planning: deciding the team memebrs and budget for the engagement.\nSetting timelines for fieldwork and reporting.\n\n\n\n\nMateriality\nMateriality is the fundamental concept in assurance. It is the threshold of inaccuracy which surpassed, could influence users decisions.\n\nAn item is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.\n\nFor example, for a $10 billion net profit business, a $1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a $1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.\nSetting materiality thresholds ensures the assurance provide focuses on what matters most, making the engagement efficient and effective.\nMateriality is usually set as the percentage of a key figure, such as profit or revnue.\n\nEx. 5% of profit before tax, or 1-2% of total revenue."
