### Overview of Accounting

Businesses need to interact with other stakeholders.

-   A business might need a loan from the bank. How does the bank know you will pay back the loan?
-   A business might need to purchase supplies from a supplier. How does the supplier know they will get paid?
-   An investor might want to invest in your company? How does the investor know how well your company is doing, and how it is compared to the competitors?

## Types of Businesses

There are three types of businesses in accounting.

1.  **Sole trader**: a small business owned and managed by the same person. This person is legally responsible for all of the losses of the business. Sole trader firms are not as heavily regulated in terms of accounting.
2.  **Partnership**: a business owned and managed by two or more people. For example, accountancy and law firms. Each partner is a sole trader for accounting purposes, and a partnership is a collection of sole traders acting together in a business. Thus, they are jointly liable for any losses the business makes.
3.  **Company**: a company is not always owned by the managers of the business (directors), but instead, by shareholders who buy shared in the company and elect the directors to run the company. Companies have *limited liability*: the shareholders are not responsible for the losses of the company, and the company is a separate legal entity. Companies are more heavily regulated in terms of accounting standards.

Accounting is a set of standards to record business transactions, allowing comparisons between companies, and for stakeholders to make decisions. It is important the financial information has certain qualities:

-   **Relevance**: the financial information is relevant to the decisions that need to be made.
-   **Faithful Representation**: show what really happened with business transactions (accurate/truthful).
-   **Comparable**: financial information needs to be comparable to other businesses, or previous/future years.
-   **Understandable**: clear and easy to read.
-   **Timely**: up to date
-   **Verifiable**: checked by someone else, like an auditor.

### Financial Statments

The accounting process takes all of these different business transactions and tries to make them comparable/understandable/relevant by summarising information in 3 statements:

1.  The **statement of financial position**, also called the **balance sheet**, states the assets, liabilities, and equity of the business at a given date (a snapshot in time).
    -   Contains assets (what the firm owns), liabilities (what the firm owes to external sources), and equities (what the firm owes to owners/shareholders).
2.  The **statement of profit or loss**, also called the **income statement**, summarises the revenues and expenses during a period.
    -   Helps calculate the profitability of the company.
3.  The **cash flow statement** shows the flows of cash in and out of the business to indicate how much cash the business has on hand to pay off obligations.

The profit/loss from the statement of profit or loss makes its way into the statement of financial position through retained earnings.

### Assets, Liabilities, Equity

There are three types of accounts in the statement of financial position:

1.  **Assets**: these are things that the business *owns* or *controls*. These are split into non-current and current assets.
    -   Non-current assets are assets a business has that it intends to use for more than one year (often several years) to help them earn profits without selling these assets. For example, land, buildings, machines, patents, vehicles, tools, equipment, and other assets are used by the company long-term to produce profit.
    -   Current assets are ones that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months. These are usually things the business aims to sell in order to generate profits. The most notable assets are inventories, cash, and receivables.
2.  **Liabilities**: liability is an amount owed by the business. These include loans, delayed payments, and bank overdrafts. Non-current liabilities are payments the firm needs to make in more than 1 year into the future, while current liabilities are liabilities that need to be paid soon.
3.  **Equity** (capital): recall that the company and owner are separate legal entities. Thus, if the business puts money into a business, the business owes this money to the owner. Equity is what the firm owes to its owners/shareholders.
    -   *Opening capital* is the amount which the owners have invested in the business at the start of the year/start of the business.
    -   *Capital injections* is the amount the owners have invested in the business during the year.
    -   *Profits* are funds generated by the business. Profits are equity (well the part that is not put back/reinvested into the business).
    -   *Drawings* are the amounts of funds taken out of the business by an owner.

Equity can also be defined as how much the owners/shareholders would get if the company sold all its assets, and settled all its liabilities.

### Double Entry Accounting

The accounting equation is **assets = liabilities + capital**.

-   Or alternatively, **assets - liabilities = capital**. We often call assets - liabilities **net assets**.

This equation will always hold true for the business. Why? If the business owns something (asset), it must have gotten the money for it somewhere (liabilities or equity).

This means for **every transaction** a business makes, there must be an equal change on both sides of this equation.

-   If there is an inequality, this usually indicates some mistake in recording transactions.

Alternatively, we use **debits** and **credits** to express this equation. Debits and credits represent changes in accounts (such as inventory, cash, etc.).

|                 | Debit    | Credit   |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Assets**      | Increase | Decrease |
| **Liabilities** | Decrease | Increase |
| **Equity**      | Decrease | Increase |

Debits and credits should be equal to each other for each transaction a firm makes.

-   Ex. If the firm buys £10 of inventory (an asset) with cash (an asset), that means debit (increase) inventory by £10 and credit (decrease) cash by £10. Thus, debits and credits are equal.
-   Ex. If Kevin starts his firm by injecting £1,000 into his firm, he credits (increases) equity by £1,000 and debits (increases) cash assets by £1,000. Once again, debits and credits are balanced.
