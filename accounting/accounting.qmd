### Overview of Accounting

When investors look to invest in a firm, they need to know how the firm is doing. Is the business profitable? Does it have enough funds to pay off its obligations? Accounting is the process of producing accounts to answer these questions.

## Types of Businesses

There are three types of businesses in accounting.

1.  **Sole trader**: a small business owned and managed by the same person. This person is legally responsible for all of the losses of the business. Sole trader firms are not as heavily regulated in terms of accounting.
2.  **Partnership**: a business owned and managed by two or more people. For example, accountancy and law firms. Each partner is a sole trader for accounting purposes, and a partnership is a collection of sole traders acting together in a business. Thus, they are jointly liable for any losses the business makes.
3.  **Company**: a company is not always owned by the managers of the business (directors), but instead, by shareholders who buy shared in the company and elect the directors to run the company. Companies have *limited liability*: the shareholders are not responsible for the losses of the company, and the company is a separate legal entity. Companies are more heavily regulated in terms of accounting standards.

There are three main statements used in accounting:

1.  The **statement of financial position**, also called the **balance sheet**, states the assets, liabilities, and equity of the business at a given date.
2.  The **statement of profit or loss**, also called the **income statement**, summarises the results of business transactions during a period.
3.  The **cash flow statement** shows the flows of cash in and out of the business to indicate how much cash the business has on hand to pay off obligations.

Bookkeeping is the recording of business and commercial transactions to enable these transactions to be summarised in the above accounting statements.

### Assets, Liabilities, Equity

There are three types of accounts in the statement of financial position:

1.  **Assets**: these are things that the business *owns* or *controls*. These are split into non-current and current assets.
    -   Non-current assets are assets a business has that it intends to use for more than one year (often several years) to help them earn profits without selling these assets. For example, land, buildings, machines, patents, vehicles, tools, equipment, and other assets are used by the company long-term to produce profit.
    -   Current assets are ones that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months. These are usually things the business aims to sell in order to generate profits. The most notable assets are inventories, cash, and receivables.
2.  **Liabilities**: liability is an amount owed by the business. These include loans, delayed payments, and bank overdrafts. Non-current liabilities are payments the firm needs to make in more than 1 year into the future, while current liabilities are liabilities that need to be paid soon.
3.  **Equity** (capital): recall that the company and owner are separate legal entities. Thus, if the business puts money into a business, the business owes this money to the owner. Equity is what the firm owes to its owners/shareholders.
    -   *Opening capital* is the amount which the owners have invested in the business at the start of the year/start of the business.
    -   *Capital injections* is the amount the owners have invested in the business during the year.
    -   *Profits* are funds generated by the business. Profits are equity (well the part that is not put back/reinvested into the business).
    -   *Drawings* are the amounts of funds taken out of the business by an owner.
