# **Introduction**

### Financial Statements

Summarising transactions: this provides information about the company to stakeholders. Stakeholders can include shareholders, investors, employees, banks, or any users that may interact with the company. This takes the form of 4 financial statements:

## Balance Sheet

The statement of financial position (balance sheet) reflects the **position** of a business at a specific point in time (end of accounting period, snapshot in time).

This includes the assets (the things the company owns), the liabilities (what the company owes), and the equity (the investment in the company).

+--------------------------------------+----------------+
| Current Assets                       | £--            |
|                                      |                |
| Non Current Assets                   | £--            |
|                                      |                |
| **Total Assets**                     | £--            |
+--------------------------------------+----------------+
| Equity                               | £--            |

## Income Statement

The **statement of profit or loss** (income statement) reflects the **performance** (profitability) of a business over a period of time (usually a year).

The income statement starts with the revenue of the year, then subtracts different revenue expenditures until we reach the net profit figure.

+------------------------------------+----------------+
| Revenue                            | £–             |
+------------------------------------+----------------+
| less Cost of Sales                 | (£–)           |
|                                    |                |
| **Gross Profit**                   | £–             |
+------------------------------------+----------------+
| (less) Operating Expenses          | (£–)           |
|                                    |                |
| **Operating Profit**               | £–             |
+------------------------------------+----------------+
| Finance income (bank interest)     | £–             |
|                                    |                |
| (less) Financing Expenses          | (£–)           |
|                                    |                |
| **Profit before Tax**              | £–             |
+------------------------------------+----------------+
| (less) Tax Expenses                | (£–)           |
|                                    |                |
| **Net Profit**                     | £–             |
+------------------------------------+----------------+

## Cash Flows

The **statement of cash flows** shows how **cash** is entering and exiting the business over a period of time. Useful to see if the company has enough cash to pay off short term loans/liabilities.

## Changes in Equity

The **statement of changes in equity** shows how **equity** (stock/shares) are changing in a business over a period of time. Useful to see how the company is issuing shares.

### Types of Businesses

There are several types of businesses, that will affect the reporting standards and legal liability of businesses.

+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| **Sole Trader**    | A business owned and operated by one person. Common with small businesses.                                                         | The owner is **personally liable** for any losses.                               |          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| **Partnership**    | A business owned and operated by a joint number of partners (a collection of sole traders). Common with law and accountancy firms. | The partners are **personally liable** for any losses.                           |          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| **Company**        | A business that is a separate legal entity. It is owned by **shareholders**, who elect **directors** to run the business.          | ***Limited liability*** - the shareholders are not personally liable for losses. |          |
|                    |                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                  |          |
|                    | -   Limited Liability Companies (LLC): privately owned, no trading shares.                                                         |                                                                                  |          |
|                    | -   Public Limited Company (PLC): publicly owned, shares are traded.                                                               |                                                                                  |          |
|                    | -   Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP): a partnership that is a separate legal entity.                                           |                                                                                  |          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| **Not-for-Profit** | Charities, clubs and societies, and government/public sector organisations (ex. NHS).                                              |                                                                                  |          |
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[20,35,20,25\]"}

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Personal Liability

When saying personal liability, this means people can have their personal belongings repossessed to pay off the debts of a business.

-   A person's private car and house can be taken away.

In limited liability, only the money the person invested can be lost. Their personal belongings are not at risk even if the company is in debt.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Business Entity Concept

No matter the type of business, their financial statements should only include transactions related to the business. This is the business entity concept - the business is a separate entity (even if legal liability is not separate).

-   Ex. most sole traders should have a separate account for personal and business matters. Personal matters should not be included in the financial statements.
-   If a sole trader needs to pull things in and out of a business, they invest capital into the business (equity increase), or draw from the business (equity decrease).

### Accounting Principles

Accounting is a set of standards to record business transactions, allowing comparisons between companies, and for stakeholders to make decisions. It is important the financial information has certain qualities:

-   **Relevance**: the financial information is relevant to the decisions that need to be made.
-   **Faithful Representation**: show what really happened with business transactions (accurate/truthful).
-   **Comparable**: financial information needs to be comparable to other businesses, or previous/future years.
-   **Understandable**: clear and easy to read.
-   **Timely**: up to date
-   **Verifiable**: checked by someone else, like an auditor.

<br />

# **Accounting Concepts**

### Accounting Equation

The **accounting equation** is the following equation:

> **Assets = Liabilities + Equity** $\implies$ **Assets - Liabilities = Equity**

::: panel-tabset
## Assets

Assets are things the company owns, that helps it generate profit. They are divided into current assets and non-current assets.

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Current Assets**     | Assets you plan to liquidate (turn into cash, move around, sell) within the next 12 months as part of making business. | Inventory, Cash, Cash at bank, Trade Receivables (things customers need to pay to you), Prepayments. |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Non-Current Assets** | Assets you do not plan to sell/move on from in the next 12 months, but still help generate profit.                     | Property Plant Equipment, Fixtures, Vehicles, Factories, Computers, Capital Expenditures.            |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[25,40,35\]"}

## Liabilities

Liabilities are things the company owes to external lenders. For example, money they owe to the bank or suppliers. They are divided into current and non-current liabilities.

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Current Liabilities**     | Things you owe to external lenders that are due within 12 months.       | Short Term Borrowings, Trade Payables (things you need to pay), Provisions, Overdrafts. |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Non-Current Liabilities** | Things you owe to external lenders that are due in more than 12 months. | Bank Loan.                                                                              |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[25,40,35\]"}

## Equity

Equity is the investment of the shareholders of the company. Equity consists of the following accounts:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Shares/Capital**    | The direct investment of shareholders/owners. This includes share premium and share capital (discussed later).                             | Share Premium, Share Capital, Injections |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Retained Earnings** | The accumulated profits/loss of the business. Each new year profit is added/subtracted from it.                                            | Retained Earnings.                       |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Drawings**          | When the owners take out money. This can be a sole trader taking a computer out to give to their kid, or dividends issued to shareholders. | Dividends, Drawings.                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[25,40,35\]"}

Based on the above, we can determine the ending equity of a period is:

> **(Ending) Equity = Injection of Shares + Opening Equity + Profit - Drawings**
:::

The accounting equation is **always true**: the statement of financial position's listed assets, liabilities, and equity should always equal/balance.

This equation implies the **duality concept**: that every transaction that affects one side of the equation, must also affect the other side of the equation, in order to keep the accounting equation true.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Net Assets

Net assets are defined as:

> **Net Assets = Assets - Liabilities**

Net current assets are defined as:

> **Net Current Assets = Current Assets - Current Liabilities**
:::

<br />

### Expenditures

There are two main types of expenditures accounts that are also important to note, since these go on different financial statements:

::: panel-tabset
## Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure are expenses used to acquire long-term assets, or to improve or enhance the earning capacity (not maintenance, only improvement) of long term assets you already hold.

-   Ex. Purchasing a factory is acquiring a long-term asset.
-   However, painting it or repairing it is not enhancing the earning capacity, only maintaining it.

Capital expenditures are included in **non-current assets** in the **statement of financial position**.

## Revenue Expenditure

Revenue expenditure is incurred for either:

1.  Purchases for trade purposes, such a raw material, inventory (cost of goods sold), operating expenses (wages, rent, administrative), tax expenses (see below).
2.  To repair/maintain a non-current asset. For example, repairing the roof of a factory is a revenue expenditure, not a capital expenditure.

Revenue expenditure is classified into expenses on the **statement of profit or loss**. However, since the net profit is added to retained earnings in the equity section of the balance sheet, it is also indirectly in the balance sheet.
:::

Revenue Expenditures are divided further into these expense accounts:

+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Cost of Sales**      | The cost of purchasing the inventory that was sold to generate the revenue in the accounting period. | Ex. Cost of inventory/goods sold. |
|                        |                                                                                                      |                                   |
|                        | Can be calculated as: *opening inventory + purchases - closing inventory*.                           |                                   |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Operating Expenses** | The expenses involved in operating the business day-to-day outside of cost of sales.                 | Ex. wages, rent, utility bills.   |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Finance Expenses**   | Expenses needed for finance/loan arrangements.                                                       | Ex. interest payments.            |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Tax Expenses**       | Expenses needed to pay taxes owed.                                                                   | Ex. Tax                           |
+------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

## Individual Judgement

Many figures in financial statements are derived from the application of judgment in applying accounting concepts. This means different people can reach different conclusions.

-   Example: determining whether expenditure is revenue or capital.
-   Other examples: valuation of buildings, depreciation, etc.

### Accounting Errors

There are 5 main types of errors:

1.  **Errors of omission**: forgetting to include a transaction in the accounts.
2.  **Transposition errors**: when an accountant accidentally swaps the positions of digits in an entry. For example, instead of £3,850, they record it as £3,580.
3.  **Errors of principle**: when an accountant records a transaction that breaks the rules/standards of accounting.
4.  **Errors of commission**: when an accountant records a transaction in the correct large account but wrong sub-account. For example, they correctly choose asset/liability/equity, but put it in the wrong account. The most common is recording one expense as another.
5.  **Compensating errors**: when two are more errors offset each other, resulting in a correct balance for all accounts, but the individual errors are still there.

To correct errors, we should take a few steps.

1.  Identify the incorrect entry. Note the values included in this incorrect entry.
2.  Decide what the correct entry should be. Note the values included in this correct entry.
3.  Compare the result of the first two steps, and create a journal entry to fix the error. This journal entry should correct the account balances from the incorrect entry to the correct entry. We do not withdraw the old entry, just a new entry to correct the difference.

**Suspense accounts** are a way to avoid errors in the first place. Sometimes, you know one account for the entry debits/credits, but you are not sure about another. Thus, instead of putting the unknown side of the transaction into a wrong account, you can put it into a temporary account called a suspense account. Later, you can correctly record the transaction.

### Double Entry Accounting

The accounting equation is **assets = liabilities + capital**.

-   Or alternatively, **assets - liabilities = capital**. We often call assets - liabilities **net assets**.

This equation will always hold true for the business. Why? If the business owns something (asset), it must have gotten the money for it somewhere (liabilities or equity).

This means for **every transaction** a business makes, there must be an equal change on both sides of this equation. If there is an inequality, this usually indicates some mistake in recording transactions.

Alternatively, we use **debits** and **credits** to express this equation. Debits and credits represent changes in accounts (such as inventory, cash, etc.).

![](images/paste-2.png){width="60%"}

Debits and credits should be equal to each other for each transaction a firm makes.

-   Ex. If the firm buys £10 of inventory (an asset) with cash (an asset), that means debit (increase) inventory by £10 and credit (decrease) cash by £10. Thus, debits and credits are equal.
-   Ex. If Kevin starts his firm by injecting £1,000 into his firm, he credits (increases) equity by £1,000 and debits (increases) cash assets by £1,000. Once again, debits and credits are balanced.

<br />

### Limited Companies

A Limited Company is created when an individual or group incorporates a company as a separate legal identity to themselves. This means owners become shareholders in the company, and the company is a separate company. This is different than a sole trader who is responsible for the company.

Incorporation changes a few things compared to sole traders in terms of legal requirements regarding accounting and financial statements.

-   Companies are required to provide more details in their financial statements. This is because companies tend to have more shareholders, who have a financial interest in the company. This does not apply to sole traders, who themselves own the business.
-   Sole traders legally only need to file accounts for tax purposes. Limited companies must maintain financial records and file them with authorities. In the UK, they must be filed annually with companies house.
-   Public companies (who are traded on the stock market) must make financial statements publicly available for anyone to read.
-   Companies need to prepare statements regarding changes in equity.

Another terminology difference is capital/equity. Sole traders hold capital in their companies, while shareholders in a limited company hold equity.

The actual financial statements may differ as well between sole traders and companies:

-   In the income statement, companies report tax expenses, but sole traders do not report tax expenses. This is because for a sole trader, the company is not a separate legal entity, so the sole trader files their own tax return. As a result, limited companies will have a [profit before tax]{.underline} and [net profit]{.underline} on their statement.
-   In the income statement expenses, limited companies must more clearly report expenses grouped by headings, such as "distribution costs", "advertising costs", or "administrative expenses" for example. Sole traders do not need to go into this detail.

<br />

### Accrual Accounting

In accounting, cash flow is not equal to profit/sales/expenses. For example, if a customer buys a product on credit (so without paying immediately), this sale is already counted in sales/expenses/COGS for the profit statement, even **before the cash has arrived**.

This type of accounting applies to many different scenarios:

-   For purchases on credit, the sale/COGS is recognised immediately, even when the cash has yet to leave.
-   For pre-payments of expenses (like paying rent ahead of time), the expense is for a later period, but the cash has already left.

When we record transactions in the income statement is called the **accrual basis of accounting**.

-   We record profit/expenses for the specific time period in which the transaction occurred, not when the cash transfer occurred.
-   Sales are recorded when they are earned, not when the money is actually received. For example, if the sale occurred in March but the cash was received in April, the sale (and COGS of the sale) go into the March accounts.
-   Expenses are recorded when they are incurred, rather than when they are paid. For example, if rent for March is paid in April, the rent is considered a March expense.

The income statement always uses the accrual basis of accounting.[^1] Thus, another statement, the cash flow statement, represents the cash flows in and out of a business, and connects the opening and closing cash balances from the balance sheet.

[^1]: In the UK, only small self-employed businesses or partnerships with revenue less than £150,000 can use cash-flow accounting.

This accrual form of accounting requires two expense accounts.

1.  **Accruals**: accruals are a current period expense, that will not be paid until the next period.
    -   To complete the double entry in the current period, we would DR (increase) the electricity expense, and CR (increase) the electricity accrual (liability).
    -   To complete the double entry once paid later, we would DR (decrease) the electricity accrual (liability), and CR (decrease) the cash (asset).
2.  **Prepayments**: prepayments are a future period expense, that have been paid during this period.
    -   To complete the double entry in the payment period, we would DR (increase) the electricity prepayment (asset), and CR (decrease) cash (asset).
    -   To complete the double entry once the service has been delivered, we would CR (decrease) the electricity prepayment (asset), and DR (increase) the electricity expense.
