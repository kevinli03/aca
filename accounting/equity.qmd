### Statement of Changes in Equity

For companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:

1.  **Retained Earnings**: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.
2.  **Share Capital**: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.
    -   For example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.
    -   This capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as **shares**. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.
    -   This initial share price (ex. £1) is called the **Par Value** or **Nominal Value**, and will [never change]{.underline}, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an **ordinary** share.
3.  **Share Premium**: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.
    -   Lets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.
    -   Shares cannot be issued below the par value.
    -   Lets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.
    -   Since the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a **share premium** of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.
    -   The remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.

The statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.

The statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.

-   It lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).
-   Then it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.
-   The closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.

Thus, the statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.

### Accounting Errors

There are 5 main types of errors:

1.  **Errors of omission**: forgetting to include a transaction in the accounts.
2.  **Transposition errors**: when an accountant accidentally swaps the positions of digits in an entry. For example, instead of £3,850, they record it as £3,580.
3.  **Errors of principle**: when an accountant records a transaction that breaks the rules/standards of accounting.
4.  **Errors of commission**: when an accountant records a transaction in the correct large account but wrong sub-account. For example, they correctly choose asset/liability/equity, but put it in the wrong account. The most common is recording one expense as another.
5.  **Compensating errors**: when two are more errors offset each other, resulting in a correct balance for all accounts, but the individual errors are still there.

To correct errors, we should take a few steps.

1.  Identify the incorrect entry. Note the values included in this incorrect entry.
2.  Decide what the correct entry should be. Note the values included in this correct entry.
3.  Compare the result of the first two steps, and create a journal entry to fix the error. This journal entry should correct the account balances from the incorrect entry to the correct entry. We do not withdraw the old entry, just a new entry to correct the difference.

**Suspense accounts** are a way to avoid errors in the first place. Sometimes, you know one account for the entry debits/credits, but you are not sure about another. Thus, instead of putting the unknown side of the transaction into a wrong account, you can put it into a temporary account called a suspense account. Later, you can correctly record the transaction.
