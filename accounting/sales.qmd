# **Sales Bookkeeping**

### Cost of Sales

In every accounting period, a firm generates revenue/sales. The cost of sales is the cost of the inventory that generated the revenue/sales of that period.

Calculating the cost of sales is typically done with the following equation:

$$
\text{Cost of Sales} = \text{Open Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Returns} - \text{Close Inventory}
$$

-   Open inventory is the opening inventory balance at the start of the period. It is also the closing balance of inventory from the last period.
-   Purchases are the value of purchases in the time period (including inward delivery costs).
-   Returns are the value of the purchases that were returned to the supplier.
-   Close inventory is the value of the inventory at the end of the period (valuation techniques are in the Inventory and NCA page).

A few key notes on this equation:

-   For valuing the closing/opening inventory balance, see the asset accounting page.
-   Purchase value includes all costs associated with getting the inventory into your hands. This includes delivery fee for delivery from supplier to you, and import duties.
-   When purchasing new inventory, they should be recorded as **Dr Purchases** (Expense account), **Cr Cash/Payables**. Do not record transactions with inventory as an account - inventory is only counted and valued at the end of periods.

<br />

### Returns and Discounts

During business, you will often encounter returns and discounts. The accounting of returns and discounts depends on if they apply to you and your customer, or you and your supplier.

::: panel-tabset
## Returns

The recording of sales (selling to a consumer) and purchases (buying from a supplier) are typically done as:

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **Sales** (selling to customer) | **Purchases** (buying from supplier)        |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Dr Cash/Expenses (increase)     | Dr Purchases (increase)                     |
|                                 |                                             |
| Cr Revenue (increase)           | Cr Cash (decrease) / Cr Payables (increase) |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

However, sometimes, the consumer (or us) will want to return a good. For returns, we simply "undo" the transaction with the reverse record:

+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **Sales** (selling to customer) | **Purchases** (buying from supplier)        |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Dr Revenue (decrease)           | Dr Cash (increase) / Dr Payables (decrease) |
|                                 |                                             |
| Cr Cash (decrease)              | Cr Purchases (decrease)                     |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

Sometimes, some companies will have a separate expense account for returns (so instead of Dr Revenue, they would Dr Returns).

## Discounts

For discounts, we **initially** record what you expect to receive/pay (including likely discounts). However, you may need to go back and adjust this. This is because of **early settlement** discounts: a discount for paying early after you have received the good.

-   Ex. I buy materials on credit for 6100. The supplier offers a Â£5 discount if you pay within 10 days. If I do pay off within 10 days and get the discount, this may require adjustment in the books.
-   Note: if your expectation of discount is actually come true, then no adjustment is needed.

+------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
|                        | Initially                       | Once Paid                                     |
+========================+=================================+===============================================+
| **Sales**              | Dr Receivables (expected price) | Cr Recievables (expected price)               |
|                        |                                 |                                               |
| (selling to customer)  | Cr Revenue (expected price)     | Dr Cash (actual paid price)                   |
|                        |                                 |                                               |
|                        |                                 | Cr/Dr Revenue (different to balance dr/cr)    |
+------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **Purchases**          | Cr Payables (expected price)    | Dr Payables (expected price)                  |
|                        |                                 |                                               |
| (buying from supplier) | Dr Purchases (expected price)   | Cr Cash (actual paid price)                   |
|                        |                                 |                                               |
|                        |                                 | Cr/Dr Purchases (difference to balance dr/cr) |
+------------------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[20,40,40\]"}

The same applies to initially expecting a discount but failing to get it. In some standards (UK GAAP), instead of Cr/Dr purchases, we Cr/Dr a separate account - discounts, to make the adjustment.

### Payroll Expense

When a firm pays its employees, it has to pay 3 things:

1.  Pay the employee's income tax to the tax collector (HRMC in the UK).
2.  Pay the employee's national insurance contribution (and the employer's additional contribution) to the tax collector.
3.  Pay the employee the remaining net salary.

The net income to the employee is paid immediately (such as at the end of the month), but the tax and national insurance is usually withheld until tax filling season.

The transaction would be as follows:

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Wages (Expense)**         | gross wages + employer national insurance             | This expense covers net salary, income tax, and employee [+ employer national insurance contribution]{.underline}. |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Cash (Asset)**            | net wages                                             | The cash of net income that is paid out to the employee.                                                           |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Tax Payable (Liability)** | income tax + employee and employer national insurance | Taxes are paid at the end of the year, so there is a liability for income tax and national insurance.              |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,30,40\]"}

When the tax is later paid to the tax authority (HMRC), the liability is reduced (debited) and cash is decreased (credited).

<br />

### Delivery Expense

There are two types of delivery expenses that might be incurred, which have to be recorded differently.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Delivery Inwards                                                                                | Delivery Outwards                                                                               |
+=================================================================================================+=================================================================================================+
| Delivery costs and expenses to deliver products [from suppliers to your inventory.]{.underline} | Delivery costs and expenses to deliver products from [your inventory to customers]{.underline}. |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This will be included/added as an expense within the **cost of sales**.                         | This is a separate expense in the **operating expenses**.                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

<br />

### Margin and Markup

Margin and markup are two relationships between the sales, cost of sales, and gross profit. They often inform companies and investors about the profitability of a firm.

**Margin** is the ratio of the gross profit to sales (revenue):

$$
\text{margin} = \frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{revenue}}
$$

**Markup** is defined as the ratio of the gross profit to sales, and can also be determined by a ratio of sales to cost of sales:

$$
\text{markup} = \frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{cost of sales}} \quad \text{or} \quad 1 + \text{markup} = \frac{\text{sales}}{\text{cost of sales}}
$$

<br />

<br />

# **Accrual Accounting**

### Matching Principle

The matching principle is that we attribute/match expenses to the revenue they help generate. For example, the bills for this year helped generate next year's revenue, would actually be considered a bill for next year, since the revenue was earned in the next year.

However, because of accruals and prepayments, the payment of bills may not be in the same period as the revenue they helped generate. The same ideas apply to income.

+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Accrued Payments** | You have received a good/service [this period]{.underline}, but you will not pay for the good/service until [next period]{.underline}. | The utility company has provided you water [this year]{.underline}, but you will not pay for it until [next year]{.underline}. This should be an expense for [this year]{.underline}. |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Prepayments**      | You will receive a good/service [next period]{.underline}, but you have already paid for it [this period]{.underline}.                 | You will get office to use [next year]{.underline}, but you have already paid for it [this year]{.underline}. This should be an expense for [next year]{.underline}.                  |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Accrued Income**   | You have earned revenue from a transaction [this period]{.underline}, but you will not be paid until [next period]{.underline}.        | Income that you earned [this year]{.underline} by building a house, but you will not bill/be paid for the work until [next year]{.underline}.                                         |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Deferred Income**  | You will earn revenue from a transaction [next period]{.underline}, but you have already been paid [this year]{.underline}.            | Income that you will earn by providing a magazine [next year]{.underline}, but you have already been paid [this year]{.underline}.                                                    |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[24,38,38\]"}

Acrruals basis of accounting means that to calculate the profit for the period, we need to include all the income and expenditure relating to the period, whether or not the cash has been received or paid, or whether or not an invoice has been issued.

<br />

### Payment Adjustments

For accrued payments and pre-payments, adjustments are necessary.

::: panel-tabset
## Accrued Expense

Let us say you receive a water service for 2024, but payment of the water bill is due in 2025. In 2024, you will originally not record anything, because you have yet to pay. However, you received the service/good for 2024, so the expense needs to be recorded in 2024.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment:

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense**                      | This is the expense for water service in 2024. This will [be on the income statement for 2024]{.underline}.                         |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Accrued Expenses (Liability)** | This is a liability - to show that you owe the water company for their service in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period. |
|                                     |                                                                                                                                     |
|                                     | This account can also be called "other payables".                                                                                   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Expense**                       | Reverse the accrued payment. You will essentially have a negative expense balance to start the year, since the expense account is set to 0 every new period. |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr. Accrued Expenses (Liability)** | Reverse the accrued payment from the carry-forward last year.                                                                                                |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, once you have paid** the water bill for 2024, you will have:

+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense** | Will cancel out the original Cr Expense. |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Cash**    | You decrease cash to pay the liability.  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

You will do the same for accrued expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.

## Prepayment

Lets say you have a water utility service for 2025, but you paid in 2024. This expense is for 2025, but because payment was in 2024, you have to adjust this so the expense is correctly allocated to 2025.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment:

+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Expense**             | Since the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this expense.                                                   |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Prepayments (Asset)** | This is an asset - basically a receivables showing you have already paid for the service, and the utility company "owes you" the service. |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.

+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense**     | Add the expense to this year (2025).                     |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Prepayments** | Reverse the prepayment from the carry-forward last year. |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

You will do the same for prepayment expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.
:::

You can do partial adjustments. For example, you pay rent for Nov 2024 to Aug 2025 in Nov 2024. You would need no adjustment in the 2024 accounts for Nov and Dec 2024, but Jan 2025 to Aug 2025 would be a prepayment.

## Calculating Expenses Quickly for Income Statement

A quick way to calculate the expenses of a year for the income statement, when you are only given cash payments are:

> **expenses on income statement = total cash amount paid for expenses in this period**
>
> **+ closing accrued expenses of this year - closing accrued expenses from last year**
>
> **+ prepayments closing from last period - prepayments closing for this period**
:::

<br />

### Income Adjustments

For accrued or deferred payment, adjustment is necessary.

::: panel-tabset
## Accrued Income

Let us say you have delivered a product in 2024, you will only be paid in 2025. Because the product was delivered in 2024, the income is for 2024, even though the payment occurs in 2025, so you have to adjust this so the revenue is correctly allocated to 2024.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue**        | This is the revenue for product in 2024. This will [be on the income statement for 2024]{.underline}.                    |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Accrued Income** | This is a asset - to show that your customer owes you for a product in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period. |
|                       |                                                                                                                          |
|                       | This account can also be called "other receivables".                                                                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Revenue**                | Reverse the accrued income. You will essentially have a negative revenue balance to start the year, since the revenue account is set to 0 every new period. |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Accrued Income (Asset)** | Reverse the accrued income from the carry-forward last year.                                                                                                |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, once you have paid** the water bill for 2024, you will have:

+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue** | Will cancel out the original Dr Revenue. |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Cash**    | You gain cash as the customer pays you.  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

You will do the same for accrued income in 2025 paid in 2026.

## Deferred Income

Lets say you will deliver a product in 2025, but you were paid in 2024. This revenue is for 2025, but because product delivery was in 2024, so you have to adjust this so the revenue is correctly allocated to 2025.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment:

+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Revenue**                     | Since the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this revenue. |
+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Deferred Income (Liability)** | This is a liability - because you owe the customer a product of this value.             |
+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.

+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue**                     | Add the revenue to this year (2025).                          |
+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Deferred Income (Liability)** | Reverse the deferred income from the carry-forward last year. |
+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

You will do the same for prepayment expenses in 2025 paid in 2026.
:::

You can do partial adjustments. For example, if you are building a house between Oct 2024 and Aug 2025, and payment is following the entire job. The parts you have already built (delivered) between Oct 2024 and Dec 2024 are revenue from the previous year, and should be adjusted.
