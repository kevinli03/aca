# **Sales and Expenses**

### Cost of Sales

In every accounting period, a firm generates revenue/sales. The cost of sales is the cost of the inventory (goods sold) that generated the revenue/sales of that period.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Opening Inventory                 | £X                                |
|                                   |                                   |
| Purchases (net, if returns exist) | £X                                |
|                                   |                                   |
| Inward Delivery Costs             | £X                                |
|                                   |                                   |
| (less) Closing Inventory          | (£X)                              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Cost of Sales**                 | **£X**                            |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

There are two types of delivery expenses that might be incurred, which have to be recorded differently.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Delivery Inwards                                                                                | Delivery Outwards                                                                               |
+=================================================================================================+=================================================================================================+
| Delivery costs and expenses to deliver products [from suppliers to your inventory.]{.underline} | Delivery costs and expenses to deliver products from [your inventory to customers]{.underline}. |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| This will be included/added as an expense within the **cost of sales**.                         | This is a separate expense in the **operating/administration expenses**.                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Returns

During business, returns will occur. The accounting of returns is as follows:

::: panel-tabset
## Customer Returns

+--------------------------------+---------------------+
| 1\) Original Customer Purchase | Dr Cash/Receivables |
|                                |                     |
|                                | Cr Revenue          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------+
| 2\) Customer Returns           | Dr Revenue          |
|                                |                     |
|                                | Cr Cash/Receivables |
+--------------------------------+---------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

Essentially, do the opposite to cancel out the original transaction.

## You Return to Supplier

+-----------------------------+------------------+
| 1\) Your Original Purchase  | Dr Purchases     |
|                             |                  |
|                             | Cr Cash/Payables |
+-----------------------------+------------------+
| 2\) Your Return to Supplier | Dr Cash/Payables |
|                             |                  |
|                             | Cr Purchases     |
+-----------------------------+------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

Essentially, do the opposite to cancel out the original transaction.

### Discounts

Discounts at the time of sale (like bulk-order discounts) are just recorded as normal transactions at their discounted price.

However, some discounts take effect later, especially with credit sales and prompt payment. For example, you might offer a customer a 5% discount if they pay within a week. You will have some expectation of whether or not the customer/or you will take the discount.

At the moment of transaction, record the sale/purchase with the **expected price**. Then, if the **actual price** later with/without the discount is different than expected, you will need to adjust.

-   If the expected price and actual price are the same, no adjustment is needed.

::: panel-tabset
## Discount to Customer

+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| 1\) Initially record credit sale with expected price | Dr Receivables: Expected Price                    |
|                                                      |                                                   |
|                                                      | Cr Revenue: Expected Price                        |
+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| 2\) Record adjustment after actual price             | Cr Receivables: Expected Price                    |
|                                                      |                                                   |
|                                                      | Dr Cash: Actual Amount Customer Paid              |
|                                                      |                                                   |
|                                                      | Dr/Cr Revenue: The balancing figure to make Dr=Cr |
+------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

Basically: initially, record expected price. Once paid, clear receivables account, record cash inflow, and balance with Dr/Cr in revenue.

## My Discount from Supplier

+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 1\) Initially record credit purchase with expected price | Dr Purchases: Expected Price                        |
|                                                          |                                                     |
|                                                          | Cr Payables: Expected Price                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 2\) Record adjustment after actual price                 | Dr Payables: Expected Price                         |
|                                                          |                                                     |
|                                                          | Cr Cash: Actual Price                               |
|                                                          |                                                     |
|                                                          | Dr/Cr Purchases: The balancing figure to make Dr=Cr |
+----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[50,50\]"}

Basically: initially, record expected price. Once paid, clear payables account, record cash outflow, and balance with Dr/Cr in revenue.

### Payroll Expense

When a firm pays its employees, it has to pay 3 things:

1.  Employee's income tax to the tax collector (HRMC in the UK).
2.  Employee's national insurance contribution (and the employer's additional contribution) to the tax collector.
3.  Employee the remaining net salary.

The net income to the employee is paid immediately (such as at the end of the month), but the tax and national insurance is usually withheld until tax filling season.

The transaction would be as follows:

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Wages (Expense)**         | gross wages + employer national insurance             | This expense covers net salary, income tax, and employee [+ employer national insurance contribution]{.underline}. |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Cash (Asset)**            | net wages                                             | The cash of net income that is paid out to the employee.                                                           |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Tax Payable (Liability)** | income tax + employee and employer national insurance | Taxes are paid at the end of the year, so there is a liability for income tax and national insurance.              |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,30,40\]"}

When the tax is later paid to the tax authority (HMRC), the liability is reduced (debited) and cash is decreased (credited).

<br />

### Margin and Markup

Margin and markup are two relationships between the sales, cost of sales, and gross profit. They often inform companies and investors about the profitability of a firm.

**Margin** is the ratio of the gross profit to sales (revenue):

$$
\text{margin} = \frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{revenue}}
$$

**Markup** is defined as the ratio of the gross profit to sales, and can also be determined by a ratio of sales to cost of sales:

$$
\text{markup} = \frac{\text{gross profit}}{\text{cost of sales}} \quad \text{or} \quad 1 + \text{markup} = \frac{\text{sales}}{\text{cost of sales}}
$$

<br />

# **Accrual Accounting**

### Matching Principle

**Matching principle**: we attribute/match expenses to the revenue they help generate. Revenue is recognised when the goods/services are **in the control of the customer**.

-   For example, the bills for this year helped generate next year's revenue, would actually be considered a bill for next year, since the revenue was earned in the next year.

+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Accrued Payments** | You have received a good/service [this period]{.underline}, but you will not pay for the good/service until [next period]{.underline}. | The utility company has provided you water [this year]{.underline}, but you will not pay for it until [next year]{.underline}. This should be an expense for [this year]{.underline}. |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Prepayments**      | You will receive a good/service [next period]{.underline}, but you have already paid for it [this period]{.underline}.                 | You will get office to use [next year]{.underline}, but you have already paid for it [this year]{.underline}. This should be an expense for [next year]{.underline}.                  |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Accrued Income**   | You have earned revenue from a transaction [this period]{.underline}, but you will not be paid until [next period]{.underline}.        | Income that you earned [this year]{.underline} by building a house, but you will not bill/be paid for the work until [next year]{.underline}.                                         |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Deferred Income**  | You will earn revenue from a transaction [next period]{.underline}, but you have already been paid [this year]{.underline}.            | Income that you will earn by providing a magazine [next year]{.underline}, but you have already been paid [this year]{.underline}.                                                    |
+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[24,38,38\]"}

Acrruals basis of accounting means that to calculate the profit for the period, we need to include all the income and expenditure relating to the period, whether or not the cash has been received or paid, or whether or not an invoice has been issued.

<br />

### Payment Adjustments

For accrued payments and pre-payments, adjustments are necessary.

::: panel-tabset
## Accrued Expense

Let us say you receive a water service for 2024, but payment of the water bill is due in 2025.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment since you received a service in 2024, so you need to expense it:

+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense**                      | This is the expense for water service in 2024. This will [be on the income statement for 2024]{.underline}.                         |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Accrued Expenses (Liability)** | This is a liability - to show that you owe the water company for their service in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period. |
|                                     |                                                                                                                                     |
|                                     | This account can also be called "other payables".                                                                                   |
+-------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Expense**                       | Reverse the accrued payment. You will essentially have a negative expense balance to start the year, since the expense account is set to 0 every new period. |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr. Accrued Expenses (Liability)** | Reverse the accrued payment from the carry-forward last year.                                                                                                |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, once you have paid** the water bill for 2024, you will have:

+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense** | Will cancel out the original Cr Expense. |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Cash**    | You decrease cash to pay the liability.  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

## Prepayment

Lets say you have a water utility service for 2025, but you paid in 2024.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment, since you have not actually received the utility (only starts in 2025).

+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Expense**             | Since the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this expense.                                                   |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Prepayments (Asset)** | This is an asset - basically a receivables showing you have already paid for the service, and the utility company "owes you" the service. |
+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.

+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Expense**     | Add the expense to this year (2025).                     |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Prepayments** | Reverse the prepayment from the carry-forward last year. |
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}
:::

You can do partial adjustments. For example, you pay rent for Nov 2024 to Aug 2025 in Nov 2024. You would need no adjustment in the 2024 accounts for Nov and Dec 2024, but Jan 2025 to Aug 2025 would be a prepayment.

## Calculating Expenses Quickly for Income Statement

A quick way to calculate the expenses of a year for the income statement, when you are only given cash payments are:

> **expenses on income statement = total cash amount paid for expenses in this period**
>
> **+ closing accrued expenses of this year - closing accrued expenses from last year**
>
> **+ prepayments closing from last period - prepayments closing for this period**
:::

<br />

### Income Adjustments

For accrued or deferred payment, adjustment is necessary.

::: panel-tabset
## Accrued Income

Let us say you have delivered a product in 2024, you will only be paid in 2025.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment, to ensure this revenue is recorded for this year.

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue**        | This is the revenue for product in 2024. This will [be on the income statement for 2024]{.underline}.                    |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Accrued Income** | This is a asset - to show that your customer owes you for a product in 2024, which will later be paid in a later period. |
|                       |                                                                                                                          |
|                       | This account can also be called "other receivables".                                                                     |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the pervious accrual balance you want to reverse the accrual. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but accrued expenses (asset) carry over their balance.

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Revenue**                | Reverse the accrued income. You will essentially have a negative revenue balance to start the year, since the revenue account is set to 0 every new period. |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Accrued Income (Asset)** | Reverse the accrued income from the carry-forward last year.                                                                                                |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, once you have paid** the water bill for 2024, you will have:

+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue** | Will cancel out the original Dr Revenue. |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Cash**    | You gain cash as the customer pays you.  |
+----------------+------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

## Deferred Income

Lets say you will deliver a product in 2025, but you were paid in 2024.

Thus, at the **year end in 2024**, you make the following adjustment, as the revenue is only for 2025, not 2024.

+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Revenue**                     | Since the service is in 2025, our 2024 statements need to remove (credit) this revenue. |
+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Deferred Income (Liability)** | This is a liability - because you owe the customer a product of this value.             |
+------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}

In **2025, as soon as the year begins**, you carry over the previous prepayment balance, and you want to reverse the prepayment. Remember that expense accounts reset their balance, but prepayment (assets) carry over their balance.

+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Cr Revenue**                     | Add the revenue to this year (2025).                          |
+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Dr Deferred Income (Liability)** | Reverse the deferred income from the carry-forward last year. |
+------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

: {.bordered .sm tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}
:::

You can do partial adjustments. For example, if you are building a house between Oct 2024 and Aug 2025, and payment is following the entire job. The parts you have already built (delivered) between Oct 2024 and Dec 2024 are revenue from the previous year, and should be adjusted.
