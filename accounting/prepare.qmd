### Composition of Equity

For companies, the balance sheet has assets, liabilities, and equity. Equity has several accounts that commonly appear:

1.  **Retained Earnings**: The accumulation of profits/losses that were not paid out as dividends or withdrawn from the business. Each year, this figure is updated based on the net profit/loss from the income statement.
2.  **Share Capital**: When a company is established, the initial money invested by the founder is known as the share capital.
    -   For example, if you invest £100,000 into starting the business, your share capital is £100,000.
    -   This capital can be divided into units of equal size, known as **shares**. For example, if £100,000 share capital is divided into 100,000 shares, then each share is £1.
    -   This initial share price (ex. £1) is called the **Par Value** or **Nominal Value**, and will [never change]{.underline}, no matter the market value of the share. This value is also noted by the value of an **ordinary** share.
3.  **Share Premium**: When the market price of shares changes, the share premium reflects this change from the initial share capital.
    -   Lets say the company needs £150,000, and found investors. They need to decide how many shares to issue, and at what price.
    -   Shares cannot be issued below the par value.
    -   Lets say the company decides to value each new share at £1.5, meaning they will issue 100,000 shares to get their funding needs.
    -   Since the share price is £1.5 compared to the par of £1, it is issued at a **share premium** of £0.5. Share premium is the value in excess of the par value.
    -   The remained of the £1 (par value) that is not the premium £0.5 is credited towards the share capital.

The statement of changes in Equity basically gives readers more information about how equity went from the starting balance to the ending balance.Since they issued 100,000 shares at a premium of £0.5, multiply together to get a share premium of £50,000.

### Statement of Changes in Equity

The statement of changes in equity explains how the value of equity has changed during the year for a company.

-   It lists the opening balance of each equity statement (retained earning, share capital, share premium).
-   Then it shows changes to this equity over the time period (usually a year). These changes can include dividends paid out, issuing more shares at a premium, and profit/loss.
-   The closing balance of the statement of changes in equity will equal the total equity in the end-of-period balance sheet.
