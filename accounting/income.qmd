title: "Statement of Profit or Loss (Income Statement)"
---

The income statement (statement of profit or loss) is one of the main statements business include in their analysis.

<br />

### Overview

The income statement starts with total revenue, then subtracts costs until we get net profit. Revenue is the total amount of money the business made from sales, including cash sales and credit sales (even if the customer has yet to pay).

From revenue, a number of things are subtracted:

1.  The **cost of sales**, or cost of goods sold (COGS) are subtracted from the revenue to obtain **gross profit**. COGS is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.
2.  Then, from gross profit, we further subtract **operating expenses** to obtain **operating profit** (profit or loss from operations). Operating expenses are a wide range of costs that are neccesary to run the business, such as rent, wages, electricity bills, telephone, research and development, etc.
3.  Then, from operating profit, we subtract **finance costs** to obtain **net profit before tax**. finance costs are expenses that are needed for financing arrangements, such as interest from loans/overdrafts.
4.  Finally, from net profit before tax, we subtract tax expenses to obtain **net profit**.

The net profit (or loss) is then added (or subtracted) to the **retained earnings** account within the capital/equity section of the balance sheet. This is usually balanced by assigning the profit/loss to the cash asset account.

### Cost of Sales

Cost of sales, or Cost of goods sold (COGS) is the cost of purchasing/producing all of the goods sold (inventory) that generated the revenue at the top of the income statement.

-   For example, if you sold 5 shoes to generate the reported revenue, the COGS should be the cost of purchasing those 5 shoes in inventory.

To calculate COGS for a specific period (like a year), we take the formula:

> *COGS = opening inventory + purchases in period - closing inventory*

This accounts for the goods that were not sold by the end of the period and remain in our inventory.
