### Assurance and Materiality

In business, assurance is when an independent professional (accountant) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the "quality"/state of the firm.

Assurance provides an independent professional opinion, increases confidence of users of information, can deter fraud, and highlight any problems or weaknesses in the information. Any assurance engagement consists of 3 parties:

1.  The **responsible party**: the management that prepares the original information
2.  The **practitioner**: usually an auditor/accountant who checks the information
3.  The **users**: people who rely on the information to make decisions/choices.

At the end of a assurance engagement, a final written report is produced. The report is addressed to the responsible party, and contains the the scope of work performed, the criteria used (such as accounting standards), and the assurance provider's opinion and conclusion, such as reasonable assurance or limited assurance.

1.  **Reasonable Assurance**: the practitioner gathers enough opinion to give a positive opinion supporting the information the responsible party has compiled. "In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view".
2.  **Limited Assurance**: the practitioner gathers less evidence. "Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the information is materially misstated". Better than no assurance, but not at the level of reasonable assurance.

<br />

### Materiality

**Materiality** is the fundamental concept in assurance. It is the threshold of inaccuracy which surpassed, could influence users decisions.

> An item is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.

For example, for a \$10 billion net profit business, a \$1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a \$1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.

Setting materiality thresholds ensures the assurance provide focuses on what matters most, making the engagement efficient and effective. Materiality is usually set as the percentage of a key figure, such as profit or revnue. Ex. 5% of profit before tax, or 1-2% of total revenue.

Assurance cannot be absolute: the practitioner cannot test every element/transaction, there may be judgment involved, and there may be limitations in the information available. There is always a small chance that material fraud or errors remain undiscovered.

-   There is also a distinction between **Error** and **Fraud**. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is [intentional]{.underline}: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.

### Agreeing an Engagement

Before an assurance engagement starts, a few things need to be done:

1.  Obtaining the engagement: practitioners can advertise their services. The responsible party can tender: invite multiple practitioners to "apply" to be their practitioner for the engagement, and choosing based on price/approach/etc.
    -   Practitioners can obtain engagements through advertising/tendering. However, they must ensure these do not compromise their independence or integrity as required by ethical standards.
2.  Accepting the engagement. A few things can influence this choice of acceptance:
    -   If there is a previous auditor, the current practitioner must communicate with them, and determine if there are any reasons not to accept (like ethical concerns). Permission must be granted by the responsible party for this communication, but if this permission is denied, the audit is almost always refused by the practitioner.
    -   The practitioner needs to assess resources.
    -   Client due diligence: verifying the identity of the business the practitioner is accepting as a client, and ensure the business is legit and not money laundering.
3.  Agreeing to terms: this is done with an engagement letter, which is a contract between the practitioner and responsible party.
    -   The engagement letter is required and regulated by standards such as ISA 210 for audits, or ISAE 3000 for other assurance engagements.
    -   The letter covers the objective and scope of the engagement, the responsibilities of the practitioner and responsible party, the reporting framework (what accounting standards), and the form and final contact of the final report.
    -   This will prevent miscommunication and disagreements later.

### Audit Risk and Planning

Assurance engagements, like audits, give confidence that information is accurate and free from material statement. However, no system is perfect, and errors/fraud can still be present even if undetected. Audit is thus about managing these risks of potential errors and fraud. There are 2 types of risks:

1.  **Business risk**: risk that events or conditions will prevent a firm from achieving its objectives. These can include economics, competitors, or new regulations. Business risks can affect the financial statements. For example, it may incentives management to lie about something (like profit, expenses) if there is financial or operational risk. Fast growing companies can also risk not having well developed controls to prevent errors and fraud.
    -   Financial risk: cash flow problems or difficulties rasing finance.
    -   Operational risk: losing a key supplier or production failures.
    -   Compliance risk: failing to follow laws or regulations which leads to fines or reputations damages.
2.  **Audit Risks**: business risks that impact the financial statements/audit process are audit risks. Audit risk is the risk that the audit conclusion is incorrect (in other words, the auditor fails to detect material mistatements). Audit risk is from the auditor's perspective. Generally, an auditor wants this risk to be minimal when issuing a reasonable assurance conclusion. Audit risk (AR) has parts: $AR=IR\times CR \times DR$:
    -   IR (Inherent Risk): the risk of a material misstatement occurring in the financial statements, due to business risks (nature of business), before considering any controls/processes to prevent these risks. Basically, the risk of an erroneous or fraudulent financial statement entries without considering controls.
    -   CR (Control Risk): the risk that a material misstatement is not prevented or detected by the firm's internal controls.
    -   DR (Detection Risk): the risk the auditor's procedures will fail to detect any material misstatements. This is managed by the auditor, and is dependent on the nature of the audit plan, the timing of the audit and procedures, and extent of audit procedures. This cannot be reduced to 0, since the auditor cannot check every single transaction of the firm.

If the inherent and control risk is high, the number of transactions and extent of audit procedures can be increased to reduce the chance of detection risk (and chance of audit risk). This is usually determined in the planning stage of an audit.

### Regulation

Regulatory bodies set the rules for auditors and the auditing process. There are a few main regulatory bodies in the UK:

-   **ICAEW** (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): sets the code of ethics for member auditors/accountants. The ICAEW code is based on the internal code of ethics established by the IESBA.
-   **FRC** (Financial Reporting Council): oversees auditors, sets the ethical standards for audit work, and supervises corporate governance and financial reporting bodies. The FRC also has a professional oversight function.
-   **IESBA** (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants): develops the international code of ethics for auditors/accountants, which serves as the foundation for the ICAEW ethics code.
-   **RSBs** (Recognised Supervisory Bodies): organisations like ICAEW that supervise auditors, and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards. These bodies work together to set, monitor, and enforce ethical standards, ensuring public trust in audits/auditors.

The ethical codes that these bodies set can be divided into two types:

-   Rule-based codes: set out specific, detailed requirements, like a checklist of what is and isn't allowed. Ex. no gifts over Â£30.
-   Principle-based codes: focus on broad principles that guide behaviour for a wide range of professional situations. They focus more on professional judgment rather than spelling out rules for every possible scenario. Ex. no gifts that could impair your objectivity (no specific max value). This is used by the ICAEW and IESBA, since they are more flexible and adaptable to new situations.

### Ethical Standards

ICAEW's ethics code is mostly principle-based, but also has some specific rule-based codes for specific things. There are 5 fundamental ethical principles for ICAEW:

1.  **Integrity**: honest, straight forward.
2.  **Objectivity**: not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to affect your business judgment.
3.  **Professional Competence and Due Care**: maintain your skills and knowledge to provide a competent service, and act in accordance with professional standards.
4.  **Confidentiality**: respect confidentiality of information, do not disclose without proper authority.
5.  **Professional Behaviour**: comply with rules and regulations, avoid conduct that would discredit the occupation.

**Independence** is key to objectivity. [Independence of mind]{.underline} is the ability to make decisions free from bias or influence. [Independence in appearance]{.underline} is avoiding situations that may make a third party doubt your impartiality, even if you are already not biased. There are several common threats to ethical behaviour:

-   **Self-Interest Threat**: When you have a financial or personal interest that may affect your judgment/bias. Ex. owning shares in a company you are auditing.
-   **Self-Review Threat**: When you are in the position of reviewing your own work, or work by your team, previously did. Ex. auditing financial statements that you yourself produced.
-   **Advocacy Threat**: When you promote a clients position to a point where your objectivity is compromised. Ex. representing a firm in a legal dispute, yet also auditing them.
-   **Familiarity Threat**: Having a long standing or close relationship with the client, making you more sympathetic to them. Ex. you are auditing a company which has your best friend as financial director.
-   **Intimidation Threat**: When you are deterred from acting objectively by external pressures. Ex. the client threatens to replace you as auditor if you do not provide favourable audit conclusion.
-   **Management Threat**: When you or your firm that influences client management decisions, and your interests become aligned with the client management. Ex. you do consulting services for a client that influences their management decisions, then you audit them.

These threats can be alleviated by profession-wide safeguards, such as training standards, quality control standards, and external reviews. They can also be done by work/company safeguards, like rotation of senior staff and policies on independence. If no safeguards are sufficient to address these threats, you should withdraw from/decline the engagement.

### Sustainability Assurance

Increasingly, stakeholders want to know how firms are managing their impact on the environment and society. Sustainability reporting discloses an organisation's environmental activities, social activities, and governance activities. This can include carbon emissions, treatment of employees, and business ethics.

The ISSB (international sustainability standards board) regulates sustainability reporting to make sure it is comparable, consistent, and useful for stakeholders. These standards include:

-   IFRS S1: General requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information. It requires companies to disclose information about sustainability risks and opportunities that may affect the companies prospects. This includes governance, strategy, risk management, metrics, and targets.
-   IFRS S2: climate related disclosures. It requires firms to report on risks about greenhouse gas emissions and financial impacts of climate change.

Sustainability reporting has become important because stakeholders (users, investors) are interested in how companies are affected by and affecting sustainability issues, such as social responsibility, climate change, or resource limitations. These can reveal potential issues, such as supply chain vulnerabilities due to climate change.

Sustainability Assurance involves an auditor reviewing the information reported in sustainability assurance. This increases the user's confidence that the reporting by the firm is accurate, and can help manage risk. In some places, like the EU, this is a legal requirement. ISSA 5000 is a regulatory code for audit assurance regarding sustainability.
