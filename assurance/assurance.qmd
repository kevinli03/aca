# **Introduction to Assurance**

### Elements of Assurance

Assurance is when an independent professional (auditor) examines financial statements or sustainability reports, to assure investors and stakeholders of the "quality"/state of the firm. This assurance given by the independent professional assures investors and stakeholders of the accuracy of the information, allowing them to make choices.

There are three parties in any assurance engagement:

1.  **Practitioner**: the auditor or independent professional.
2.  **Responsible Party**: the firm/company that is being audited. Typically, we focus on the directors of this firm/company.
3.  **Intended User**: typically stakeholders such as shareholders, investors, banks, or anyone needing to know details about a firm's financial performance.

Assurance can take many different forms:

-   **Statutory Audit**: the auditing of financial statements, governed by accounting standards and reporting regulations.
-   **Sustainability Assurance**: the auditing of a firm's sustainability figures and reports.
-   Other assurance engagements, such as due diligence before performing transactions, internal controls assessment, fraud investigations.

## Benefits and Limitations of Assurance

Benefits:

-   Independent scrutiny of the business by experts, which adds credibility to the firm's financial statements.
-   Can help deter the appeal of fraud for those in the firm.
-   Draws attention to issues, such as ethical issues or weaknesses of internal controls.
-   Reduces risk of management bias.

Limitations:

-   Assurance does not provide 100% assurance for accuracy, since you cannot possibly test and check every transaction made by a firm (especially large firms).
-   Cannot solve potential issues of collusion fraud between auditors and companies.
-   Financial information often includes subjective matters, such as depreciation and provision for doubtful debts.
-   May rely on some sub-optimal evidence, such as management representations.

### Levels of Assurance

Usually, when considering the accuracy of financial statements, auditors are concerned with **materiality**.

> An mistake is material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Materiality, Error, and Fraud

-   For example, for a \$10 billion net profit business, a \$1 mistatement is not substantial enough to influence the economic decisions of users of the report, so it is not material. However, a \$1 billion mistatement could quite substantially change how users use the report.
-   The threshold of materiality is often set at some percentage of net income before tax (ex. 5%) or revenue (1-2%).
-   There is also a distinction between **Error** and **Fraud**. Error is considered a genuine mistake of the responsible party. Fraud is [intentional]{.underline}: someone deliberately provides false information to mislead users.
:::

At the end of an engagement, the auditor needs to write an **opinion** on the level of assurance they can assure regarding the accuracy of the financial statements. There are two **levels of assurance**.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Reasonable Assurance                                                  | Limited Assurance                                                                                                  |
+=======================================================================+====================================================================================================================+
| High level of assurance of accuracy, but not absolute.                | Moderate/low level of assurance of accuracy.                                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Conclusion expressed positively.                                      | Conclusion expressed negatively.                                                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| > In our opinion, the financial statements show a true and fair view. | > Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial information is not true and fair. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Used in statutory audits.                                             | Used in all other engagements.                                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## The Expectations Gap

Users and the public often misinterpret audit opinions to mean other things. This "expectation" of the public contrasting with what audit opinions actually claim is called the expectations gap.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Public                                                                                                     | Reality                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
+============================================================================================================+================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| The public often thinks the auditor detects all fraud and error.                                           | This is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.                                                                                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The public often thinks auditors test 100% of transactions.                                                | This is not true, most audits sample transactions to test.                                                                                                                                                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The public often thinks auditors guarantee the accuracy of financial statements.                           | This is not true, the auditor only provides reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance.                                                                                                                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The public often thinks auditors guarantee the company will continue to survive for the forseeable future. | This is not true, the auditor only provides an opinion of the accuracy of financial statements. The financial statements themselves can paint a good or bad picture, the auditor only cares if it is accurate. |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The public often thinks the balance sheet shows the true value of the company.                             | This is not true, valuation is done by separate teams.                                                                                                                                                         |

### Legal Requirements

In the UK, all companies are required to legally undergo a statutory audit of their financial statements every year, *unless* they meet a set of exemption criteria. This requirement and the exemptions are set by the **Companies Act 2006**.

To qualify for an exemption, a firm must **not** be an insurance, banking, or listed company. In addition, they must also meet two of the following exemption critera below:

-   Firms that are in banking, insurance, or listed on a stock market **must** always undergo a statutory audit, even if they meet the criteria above.

+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Exemption After 6 April 2025 (2/3)     | Exemption After 1 January 2016 (2/3)   |
+========================================+========================================+
| **Less** than 50 employees on average. | **Less** than 50 employees on average. |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Less** than £7.5m in total assets.   | **Less** than £5.1m in total assets.   |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| **Less** than £15m in turnover.        | **Less** than £10.2m in turnover.      |
+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

### Sustainability Assurance

Sustainability is about meeting he needs of the present, without compromising the future from meeting their own needs. Sustainability consists of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

+---------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Environmental                                           | Social                                                                     | Governance                          |
+=========================================================+============================================================================+=====================================+
| About the planet. For example, emissions and pollution. | About the people. Diversity, inclusion, worker health, mental health, etc. | About company practices and ethics. |
+---------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

Because of growing demand from users for information regarding sustainability, assurance is needed to ensure that the reported sustainability metrics of a firm are accurate.

Currently, sustainability assurance and reporting is still a developing field, but several regulations already exist.

::: panel-tabset
## IFRS ISSB

IFRS sustainability and disclosure standards are issued by the International Susstainability and Standards Board (ISSB). Their 4 key objectives are:

1.  Develop standards for a global baseline of sustainability disclosures.
2.  Meet the information needs of investors.
3.  Enable companies to provide sustainability information to global capital markets.
4.  To facilitate interoperability with disclosures that are jurisdiction-specific, as well as aimed at broader stakeholder groups.

They consist of two standards:

1.  **IFRS S1**: General requirements for disclosure of sustainability-related financial information.
2.  **IFRS S2**: Climate-related disclosures.

Note: ISSB do not have power to enforce these standards, and they are not legally required for companies (except in Brazil).

## Companies Act 2006 (UK)

The strategic report within the Capanies Act includes some mandatory sustainability reporting requirements.

-   Reporting of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, including sustainability risks.
-   Information about environmental, social, and community matters, employees, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters.
-   Information about gender diversity within the company.
-   Climate related financial disclosures, such as management of climate-adjacent risks and opportunities.

These are required reporting for firms in the UK.

## TCFD (UK)

The TCFD (Task force on climate-related financial disclosures) is a set of recommendations issued in 2017, recommending the reporting of:

1.  Governance
2.  Risk Management
3.  Strategy
4.  Metrics and Targets.

In the UK, the TCFD recommendations are mandatory for listed companies. This is not the case in all countries.

IFRS S2 reporting standards are based on these TCFD recommendations.

## CSRD (EU)

The European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) came into effect in 2023. It requires the following:

-   Disclosure about a company's sustainibility related impacts, risks, and opportunities.
-   Disclosures to be reported in the annual report of a company.
-   Requires companies to seek assurance over their sustainability disclosures.

All companies that have securities listed on an EU stock market **must** follow these directives. Any EU companies that are large (more than 250 employees, 50 million euro revenue) that are not listed must also follow the directives.

-   Non-EU companies which generate more than 150 million in the EU that also have a EU listed subsidiary must also follow the directives. But this only comes into affect in 2028.

## Assurance

The *international standard on sustainability assurance **(ISSA) 5000** general requirements for sustainability assurance engagements* was released in 2024. It provides a framework for how sustainability assurance is to take place.

The objectives of the ISSA 5000:

-   The obtain reasonable assurance or limited assurance about whether the sustainability is free from material mistatement.
-   To express a conclusion on the sustainability information through a written report that conveys a audit conclusion, and describes the basis for the conclusion.

The EU CSRD also has guidelines on how to obtain limited assurance for sustainability based on the **European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)**, and also provides a provision to move towards reasonable assurance.

# **Professional Ethics**

### Ethical Codes

Regulatory bodies set the rules for auditors and the auditing process. There are a few main regulatory bodies in the UK:

-   **ICAEW** (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales): sets the code of ethics for member auditors/accountants. The ICAEW code is based on the internal code of ethics established by the IESBA.
-   **FRC** (Financial Reporting Council): oversees auditors, sets the ethical standards for audit work, and supervises corporate governance and financial reporting bodies. The FRC also has a professional oversight function.
-   **IESBA** (International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants): develops the international code of ethics for auditors/accountants, which serves as the foundation for the ICAEW ethics code.
-   **RSBs** (Recognised Supervisory Bodies): organisations like ICAEW that supervise auditors, and ensure compliance with ethical and professional standards. These bodies work together to set, monitor, and enforce ethical standards, ensuring public trust in audits/auditors.

The ethical codes that these bodies set can be divided into two types:

-   **Rule-based codes**: set out specific, detailed requirements, like a checklist of what is and isn't allowed. Ex. no gifts over £30.
-   **Principle-based codes**: focus on broad principles that guide behaviour for a wide range of professional situations. They focus more on professional judgment rather than spelling out rules for every possible scenario. Ex. no gifts that could impair your objectivity (no specific max value). This is used by the ICAEW and IESBA, since they are more flexible and adaptable to new situations.

<br />

### Ethical Principles

ICAEW's ethics code is mostly principle-based, but also has some specific rule-based codes for specific things. There are 5 fundamental ethical principles for ICAEW:

1.  **Integrity**: honest, straight forward.
2.  **Objectivity**: not allow bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence to affect your business judgment.
3.  **Professional Competence and Due Care**: maintain your skills and knowledge to provide a competent service, and act in accordance with professional standards.
4.  **Confidentiality**: respect confidentiality of information, do not disclose without proper authority.
5.  **Professional Behaviour**: comply with rules and regulations, avoid conduct that would discredit the occupation.

**Independence** is key to objectivity. [Independence of mind]{.underline} is the ability to make decisions free from bias or influence. [Independence in appearance]{.underline} is avoiding situations that may make a third party doubt your impartiality, even if you are already not biased.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## More on Independence

Independence is not necessarily threatened if auditors use the client's services, **given** the prices/services the auditors are using are also available to the public.

-   Ex. Auditors can have mortgages with a bank they are auditing, as long as those mortgages and rates are publicly available, and the mortgage was obtained prior to the engagement.
-   However, if the bank, after learning of the auditor's appointment, provides favourable mortgages to the auditors and only the auditors, then it is a conflict of interest.

## Types of Biases

+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Bias                 | Description                                                                                | Example                                                                                                                                      |
+======================+============================================================================================+==============================================================================================================================================+
| Anchoring Bias       | Tendency to use an initial piece of information, which subsequent information is assessed. | Say an item was \$50, but now is on sale for \$30. \$30 might still be an overpay, but in the context of the original price, it seems cheap. |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Automation Bias      | Tendency to blindly trust output generated from automated systems.                         | Blindly trusting the output from accounting software.                                                                                        |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Availability Bias    | Putting more weight on experiences that easily come to mind.                               | We tend to think of plane crash news stories far more than the millions who have safe plane journeys.                                        |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Confirmation Bias    | Disregarding information that does not fit our existing beliefs.                           | Common in politics.                                                                                                                          |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Groupthink           | Tendency for groups to reach a conclusion without critical reasoning.                      | Social media like Reddit.                                                                                                                    |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Overconfidence Bias  | Overestimating one's own abilities.                                                        | If you are experienced, you might not check your work as carefully and assume it is correct.                                                 |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Representation Bias  | Assuming the interactions/experiences you have are representative of all people.           |                                                                                                                                              |
+----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Selective Perception | Expectations influencing personal views.                                                   | If you expect something to be bad, you are more likely to look for the bad parts.                                                            |

### Threats to Ethics

There are several common threats to ethical behaviour:

-   **Self-Interest Threat**: When you have a financial or personal interest that may affect your judgment/bias. Ex. owning shares in a company you are auditing.
-   **Self-Review Threat**: When you are in the position of reviewing your own work, or work by your team, previously did. Ex. auditing financial statements that you yourself produced.
-   **Advocacy Threat**: When you promote a clients position to a point where your objectivity is compromised. Ex. representing a firm in a legal dispute, yet also auditing them.
-   **Familiarity Threat**: Having a long standing or close relationship with the client, making you more sympathetic to them. Ex. you are auditing a company which has your best friend as financial director.
-   **Intimidation Threat**: When you are deterred from acting objectively by external pressures. Ex. the client threatens to replace you as auditor if you do not provide favourable audit conclusion.
-   **Management Threat**: When you or your firm that influences client management decisions, and your interests become aligned with the client management. Ex. you do consulting services for a client that influences their management decisions, then you audit them.

These threats can be alleviated by profession-wide safeguards, such as training standards, quality control standards, and external reviews. They can also be done by work/company safeguards, like rotation of senior staff and policies on independence. If no safeguards are sufficient to address these threats, you should withdraw from/decline the engagement.
