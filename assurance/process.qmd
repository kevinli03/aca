# **Audit Planning**

### Planning Process

Before starting an accepted engagement, there needs to be a plan. This helps preparing the neccesary resources (funding, team size, timeline) of the audit, as well as what areas are potentially higher risk for fraud/error.

There are two documents that are needed to plan an audit engagement.

1.  **Audit strategy**: Determines the scope, timing, and direction of the audit, and shapes the audit plan.
2.  **Audit plan**: More detailed, shows how the overall strategy will be implemented.

## Audit Strategy

The key components of the audit strategy are:

1.  Understanding the client, and its environment.
2.  Materality threshold. What is considered material?
3.  Risk assessment. What are the risky areas for potential material misstatement?
4.  Nature, extent, and timing of audit procedures.
5.  Direction of the audit, who is supervising, and generally how review of the audit work will be undertaken.

## Audit Plan

The audit plan ensures the following:

1.  Attention (in-depth planning) is paid to the most important areas (high risk areas).
2.  Potential problems/risks are identified early.
3.  The audit is properly organised and managed.
4.  Work is assigned to the appropriate member of the audit team, and team members receive direction and supervision of team members.
5.  Reviews by more senior auditors are planned and facilitated.

### Understanding the Client

ISA (UK) 315 requires auditors to gain an understanding of the client. This is because [it is necessary to understand what areas have higher risk of fraud/error, in order to design an effective audit strategy and plan.]{.mark}

Specifically, auditors should understand:

-   The industry and regulatory environment of the client, which can help identify risks.
-   Nature of the client, including the client's selection and application of accounting policies.
-   Objectives and strategy of the client, and related business risks, which may affect the risk of material misstatement.
-   Measurement and review of the client's financial performance. This could indicate pressure on directors to commit fraud.
-   The strength and effectiveness of internal controls at preventing errors/fraud. If these are weak, the risk of material misstatement is higher.

Auditors also need to understand the client's financial reporting framework, and its accounting policies.

::: panel-tabset
## Financial Reporting Framework

-   What are the accounting principles and industry-specific accounting principles.
-   Reporting of revenue recognition.
-   Accounting for financial instruments.
-   Reporting of foreign currency assets, liabilities, and transactions.
-   Accounting principles for unusual or complex transactions.

## Accounting Policies

-   What are the methods used to recognise, measure, and disclose significant and unusual transactions? For example, foreign transactions.
-   How do they use accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas, where there is a lack of regulation, guidance, or consensus?
-   How do they deal with changes in the environment that may require a change in accounting policies.
-   What financial reporting standards, laws, and regulations that are new to the client.
:::

To get this information, auditors can ask the client's management, conduct analytical procedures, observe processes, and inspect documents and assets.

### Audit Risk

Auditors do not want to give a wrong opinion, since shareholders/users depend on the auditor's opinion. Thus, auditors want to lower the audit risk of an incorrect opinion, such as failing to detect fraud/errors.

The risk of an audit (audit risk) is calculated as follows:

> **Audit Risk** $=$ **Inherent Risk** $\times$ **Control Risk** $\times$ **Detection Risk**

::: panel-tabset
## Inherent Risk

-   The client's risk of error/fraud, which cannot be controlled by auditors. This is usually related to the business/industry/regulatory environment.
-   For example, if the management is under pressure, there is an inherent risk of fraud due to this pressure.
-   If certain items/transactions are new, complex, one-off, or subjective, they are high risk.

Pg. 48 see more

## Control Risk

-   How strong a client's internal controls are to detect the inherent risk of error/fraud.
-   Stronger controls mean less control risk. Weaker controls means higher control risk. This makes sense - weaker controls are more likely to fail to detect errors/fraud.
-   Auditors generally cannot control this as well.

See the [internal controls page](assurance/controls.qmd) for more details on how controls work, and how to evaluate controls.

## Detection Risk

The risk that auditors fail to detect material misstatements. If inherent risk and control risk are higher, auditors need to reduce detection risk to lower audit risk overall.

To lower detection risk, auditors can:

-   Increase the sample size that they are testing, especially for accounts with high inherent/control risk.
-   Lower the materiality threshold.
-   Improve the quality of evidence to make sure it is sufficient and appropriate.

## Sustainability Risk

Risks also exist in relation to climate change. These include:

-   **Physical Risks**: risks from the physical effects of climate change, like extreme weather and storms. For example, dependent on supply chains/stock affected by climate change, such as farming and storms.
-   **Transitional Risks**: Risks relating to shifts to a low-carbon economy, such as changes to policy, regulation, technology, and market.

These are important because they can affect the financial statements. For example, destroyed assets/inventory.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Related Parties

-   A related party is a firm who is influenced, or has influence over the client. For example, company A's director is married to company B's (our client's) company.
-   There is nothing inherently wrong with transactions involving a related party. However, they do increase the potential of manipulation between the two parties.
-   Generally, there is the principle of **arm's length**: that if the two parties were not related, the transaction's prices would still make sense.
-   Related party transactions must be disclosed separately, even if arm's length is met. These are considered [material by nature]{.underline} (regardless of the size of the transaction).
-   Related parties can be difficult to identify, and if there is manipulation, these are often concealed from auditors.

### Setting Materiality

Recall that a mistake is **material** if its [omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users of the report.]{.mark}

When determining if a transaction/error is material, there are two ways to do this:

1.  Material based on the **size** of the transaction (common thresholds below). This is determined during the planning stage.
2.  Material based on the **nature**. For example, transactions between the company and its directors must be disclosed, as these are considered material *regardless* of size. Related party transactions are also material by nature.

In higher risk businesses, the tolerance level for mistakes is lower, so we set the materiality threshold to the lower end of these ranges.

| Item              | Threshold Size |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Profit before tax | 5% to 10%      |
| Revenue           | 0.5% to 1%     |
| Total Assets      | 1% to 2%       |

## Performance Materiality

Performance materiality is an amount set by the auditor *lower* than the materiality threshold of the financial statements to reduce the risk of a specific account.

-   For example, if one branch of a large company is accused of fraud, you might have a special performance materiality for that branch, while the other branches are at the normal threshold.

## Sustainability Materiality

In sustainability assurance, materiality is assessed in a similar way.

-   ISSB sustainability materiality: sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably affect the entity's prospects that could influence the decisions of users.
-   Double materiality is a concept which considers not only the sustainability issues that reate financial risks for a company, but also the materiality of a company's impact on people and the environment.

### Analytical Procedures

Analytical procedures is comparing non-financial information (like expectations based on experience) to actual financial information. Inconsistencies in comparisons may indicate potential risk.

-   Ex. During the pandemic lockdowns, we might assume an airline would have a difficult year, and expect a net loss. If the airline actually has a net profit, that is an inconsistency that could be a result of errors/fraud.

Analytical procedures are mandatory at planning to identify potential risks, according to ISA (UK) 315. They are also required to be used to assist forming an overall conclusion based on ISA (UK) 520.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Limitations of Analytical Procedures

-   They generally require strong background knowledge and experience of the client, which may be limited if the client is new.
-   They generally require experienced staff to be effective.
-   The quality of the procedure depends on the reliability of the sources.
:::

Often, when comparing in analytical procedures, we will need to use **ratios** to see how their value or how they have changed, which can be used in the comparison with our expectations.
